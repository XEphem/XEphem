How to install XEphem, either for just yourself or system-wide:

1) Build the executable:

    Download the tarfile.

        https://github.com/XEphem/XEphem/archive/refs/tags/4.2.0.tar.gz

    Extract it and change directory:

	$ tar xfz xephem-4.2.0.tar.gz
	$ cd xephem-4.2.0/GUI/xephem

    On a Linux similar to Ubuntu or Debian, do this (on other Linux
    distributions, look for Motif packages equivalent to the ones
    installed here):

	$ sudo apt install build-essential groff-base libmotif-dev libssl-dev libxext-dev libxmu-dev libxt-dev
	$ make

    On Mac OS X just do this:

	$ make MOTIF=../../libXm/osx

    On OpenVMS just do this (from this directory):

	$@build
	$set def [.GUI.XEPHEM]
	$run xephem

    Otherwise edit Makefile to set the MOTIFI and MOTIFL macros for
    your system then make. If you can not find Motif on your system try
    using your package manager to search for it, for exampe:
        $ yum search openmotif
        $ zypper search openmotif
    or look for binary kits at http://motif.ics.com/motif or build from
    source from http://sourceforge.net/projects/motif. You'll also need
    a bunch of supporting X11 Windows stuff too, but decent package
    managers will bring those dependencies in for you also automatically.
    In all cases, you'll want the development versions so you can use them
    to build new programs, not just run existing ones.

2) For a sneak peek, run it now; then click File->Quit and go to the next step:

	$ ./xephem

	If you get a message "X Resources out of date" you have installed
	XEphem before and must locate and remove the old resource file.

Next do either 3a or 3b, not both:

3a) Installing XEphem for just yourself without root permission (see
    next step for system-wide multiuser installation):

    3a.1 Copy the executable where you keep your private programs:

	$ cp xephem $HOME/bin			# or where ever

    3a.2 Create a directory off your HOME called .xephem for all per-user files

	$ mkdir $HOME/.xephem

    3a.3 Create an initial resource file called $HOME/.xephem/XEphem with
    just one line in it as follows:

	XEphem.ShareDir: <dir>

    where <dir> is the full path of the directory containing the directories
    auxil, catalogs, fifos, fits, gallery, help, and lo. These are in the
    source directory of the original tar kit which is where you are now, if
    you have been following along. You can leave them here if you like or move
    them, just set <dir> to where ever they end up.

3b) Installing XEphem for multiple users (requires root permission) (skip if
    installing just for yourself):

    3b.1 Copy the executable where everyone can find it:

	$ cp xephem /usr/bin			# or elsewhere in your PATH

    3b.2 Create a directory for system-wide read-only files to be shared by all
    XEphem users and fill with the defaults included in this kit:

	$ mkdir /usr/local/xephem		# or where ever
	$ cp -R auxil /usr/local/xephem		# copy auxil dir and contents
	$ cp -R catalogs /usr/local/xephem	# copy catalogs dir and contents
	$ cp -R fifos /usr/local/xephem		# copy fifos dir and contents
	$ cp -R fits /usr/local/xephem		# copy fits dir and contents
	$ cp -R gallery /usr/local/xephem	# copy gallery images
	$ cp -R help /usr/local/xephem		# copy help files
	$ cp -R lo /usr/local/xephem		# copy lunar db

    3b.3 Create an initial resource file called /etc/XEphem with
    just one line in it as follows:

	XEphem.ShareDir: /usr/local/xephem

    If in the previous step you created a different directory than
    /usr/local/xephem, then provide that directory's path instead.

    3b.4 Copy the man page:

	$ cp xephem.1 /usr/local/man/man1	# or where ever

4) XEphem uses your browser to display Help. Open Help->Configure and select
   your browser of choice. Use %s where ever the real URL should go. If your
   browser is not listed, figure out the command line to tell it to display a
   local URL, add it to the list and send it to me so I can add it to the FAQ.

5) Done at least, now just run and go:

	$ xephem

Thanks for using XEphem!
