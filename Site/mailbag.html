<ul>
    <p><li>
    "I would just like to thank you for an excellent piece of software
    [3.7.6], and such good service. I really can recommend anyone who is
    running the free version to buy the full one. I think it's the best
    possible program for observers, not as slick as others but with far
    greater depths. Excellent!" J.F.

    <p><li>
    "Love it [3.7.4] and rely on it." C.M.

    <p><li>
    "Your program (3.7.5-RC11) is really nice; I tried it out and found, it makes good ephemeris tables,
    has flexible timepoints (even moonrise/moonset) and explains very good how
    the numbers (angles, times...) are defined."
    M.F.

    <p><li>
    "Thanks for such a great product [3.7.4]!  There are other good astro tools out there for
    linux, but I really appreciate a lot of the functions that XEphem supplies.  I love it!
    I've been using Xephem for a number of years now." C.F.

    <p><li>
    "Xephem [3.7.4]... the greatest sky program ever written.  Thank you so so
    much."  D.H.

    <p><li>
    "I love this product [3.7.4]. I'm a graduate student  in Astronomy and
    use it both in planning for, and during my hosted public observing
    sessions, my research observing sessions and my personal amateur sessions.
    There's nothing better. It's lightweight yet powerful, very configurable
    and has an incredibly compact display considering all the information it
    conveys."  L.N.

    <p><li>
    "XEphem [3.7.3] is truly a great program. Thank you for it, and for the
    good support."  L.B.

    <p><li>
    "I bought Xephem few years back and I never regret it. Product is nice,
    stable, and full with features." I.M.

    <p><li>
    "Overall, a wonderful job and I hope to have a lot of fun with this  
    program [3.7.3]." M.T.

    <p><li>
    "I have found xephem [3.7.2] very enjoyable. I find it accurate, flexible,
    and easy to use. I have used many of its vast array of features." anon

    <p><li>
    "I like your program [3.7.2] and appreciate all the effort that went into
    it. I am using it on Mac OS X Leopard. You are very kind to provide so
    robust a program for such a low price!". C.M.

    <p><li>
    "Really enjoying this Xephem software [3.7.2], very powerful and full of
    surprises. Just amazing to have this on the Linux system. As a ham radio
    operator and backyard astronomer as well as earthquake precursor reseacher
    I find this software to very helpful in a number of areas." M.

    <p><li>
    "I've been using Xephem for a long, long time it seems.  It's
    always been a fantastic program and was probably one of the motivating
    reasons for me to experiment with Linux back in '93." K.F.

    <p><li>
    "I've been using Xephem for years for education, for public
    nights, and for help.  It is a terrific tool." C.C.

    <p><li>
    "I have had hours of fun with xephem. Thanks again for a wonderful piece
    of software." W.C.

    <p><li>
    "I find XEphem [3.7.1] a bit addictive. I've been playing with it while I
    should be doing other things! ;-)" R.L.

    <p><li>
    "I have been using XEphem for a little under a month
    now, and find it to be exceptional. It does more than I
    will ever need. I was used to The Sky (had since it was
    called EZ Cosmos) and recently Cartes Du Ciel.
    I think that XEphem is as good, or better than those
    hands down. (considering all that it does)" A.M.

    <p><li>
    "... XEphem [3.7] ... is really an excellent piece of software. Thank you
    for doing this outstanding work!" F.J.

    <p><li>
    "I tried many other planetarium software, but this [3.7] is by far the
    best. I look forward to use it with my telescope after my CCD camera is
    build (Audine). Thanks for this excelent software." I.M.

    <p><li>
    "I bought XEpehem 3.7 for MacOS X and love it." F.G.

    <p><li>
    "I must say XEphem [3.7] looks way cool on my iMac G5's 20 inch screen :)"
    R.B.

    <p><li>
    "I love the software [3.7]. It's my primary tool for running my LX200
    classic." J.B.

    <p><li>
    "I managed to install it [3.7] just fine on OS X 10.3.9, and I ran it...
    and I'm impressed! It's faaaaaaantastic!" A.D.

    <p><li>
    "Keep up the good work, I've tried nearly all
    astronomy software in the last four years (some
    commercial, mostly freeware) they all do the job okay
    but none of them are as fascinating as XEphem [3.6],
    honestly. I love the rendering of the sky view, it looks real
    without excess. Excellent help file also." M.J.

    <p><li>
    "I like XEphem very much. I have previously used starry night, which  
    looks nice but have found it unsatisfying to use (I'm not quite sure  
    why). XEphem certainly has  a steeper learning curve but I am  
    discovering that everything I need is there. It works very nicely." R.A.

    <p><li>
    "I'm so impressed that you have taken the software [3.6] in this
    direction. I'm especially pleased that I will now be able to stop using
    windows and only use my solaris machines to control my LX200s." L.R.

    <p><li>
    "The collection of data and other files really "makes"
    the product [3.6] and it's installation a snap. I compiled the source,
    looked at the product, and then downloaded the commercial version. The
    commercial version was a long download, but, it was really easy to
    install. Before this, I worked with the main Windoze astronomy
    products, believe me Xephem is a bargain for the price." D.H.

    <p><li>
    "I have used XEphem since version 3.4 and I'm still here [3.6],
    thank's for producing a great piece of software." C.I.

    <p><li>
    "The added and improved features from 3.5.2 [to 3.6.4] are outstanding. I
    was surprised to see that the Sky View even _looked_ prettier (I never
    thought it looked bad, but somehow it's eyecandier now)." G.B.

    <p><li>
    "Whow! The improvement from XEphem 3.5 to 3.6 has really impressed me. 
    Please, continue the development of this wonderfull software.  XEphem is
    my favorite planetary program. But to me, the most convincing feature are
    its elaborate plotting routines." V.H.

    <p><li>
    "First and foremost, this program far exceeds what I ever expected to
    find. Every time I would think that I'd just about covered it all, I'd
    find a new feature. (The manual is, after all, about 100 pages long.)
    Thanks for such an awesome open source program!" J.N.

    <p><li>
    "I've got to tell you that this [3.6] is one of the finest pieces of
    software that I've ever encountered.  I have several planetarium programs
    (mostly windows versions, uggghhhh) and none of them are up to the calibre
    of this one." M.A.

    <p><li>
    "I downloaded [3.6] and built the executables for Linux [RedHat] Version 9.
    Everything is working well and I am very excited about the package."
    J.B.

    <p><li>
    "I've had a look at the software over the weekend and am extremely
    impressed.  At least as good or better than the Windows software I've
    been using so far." J.S.

    <p><li>
    "Received and installed XEphem version 3.6 on Mandrake 9.2.  A
    beautifully crafted piece of software." L.L.

    <p><li>
    "VERY impressed with the capabilities and depth of help you've created for
    your program...not to mention ease of installation (iBook, OS X.1) and
    stability. Way to go! Something that I use it for frequently is to solve
    for plate constants in my CCD images and insert the WCS keywords in my
    FITS headers. For some reason, the Xephem routine seems to be more
    successful in finding a solution than other applications I've tried." T.H.

    <p><li>
    "I just received my XEphem disk today and have been playing with it all 
    afternoon. It is a superb piece of work. I'm amazed at how many 
    features it has, and that all of them are actually useful features! It 
    is a far better program than any of the others I have seen." D.J.

    <p><li>
    "Thank you for developing an awesome ephemeris/and real astronomy
    program. The wealth of information keeps an amateur astronomer
    like myself with a very valuable astronomical tool for all purposes."
    J.R.

    <p><li>
    "Great software! Running under MacOS X." D.I.

    <p><li>
    "Thank you very much for this fantastic software!
    I tried your XEphem 3.2 in a Eso-Midas distribution, and I was really
    impressed! With the new distribution, 3.4, found in Suse Linux 7.2, my
    good impression get even better." D.V.G.

    <p><li>
    "I installed XEphem in my Linux machine. I found it great!! Really a nice
    job." L.F.

    <p><li>
    "I was looking for Astronomy software that was fully complete in
    features that also would run on OS X. I did not want to beta test for
    the companies that are developing their software in transition to OS
    X .. and I've already been burned by RED Shift for the mac." P.M.

    <p><li>
    "Thanks for the help on the LX200 interface.  You were exactly right when
    you said that once it works it is a lot of fun!" M.M.

    <p><li>
    "Love the software, linux platform." S.B.

    <p><li>
    "Cool! Thanks for the prompt response. BTW, now that I
    have the manual and know more about what the sucker can do I'm even more
    impressed! Nice work!!" T.H.

    <p><li>
    "I am enjoying your program. It must be extremely satisfying to have
    developed such a piece of work. Kudos to you." M.W.
