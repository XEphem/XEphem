Follows is a random list of contributions of one sort or another related
to XEphem. We have not necessarily tested these but are happy to serve as a
central exchange for these efforts. If you have questions about these please
contact the authors directly. Send your contribution ideas to

    <a target="_blank" href="moon.fts">Here</a> is an alternative version of
    moon.fts that was made using strips of LRO images with low sun angles. It 
    is a much better match to what you see when viewing a given location while 
    it is near the terminator. Thanks to Martin Federspiel, Martin.Federspiel at gmx.de.

    <a target="_blank" href="xeseds2.1.pl-removethis">xeseds2.1.pl</a> is
    a Perl script that can be used with the fifo interface. Once running, then
    when you click on "Telescope GoTo" over many types of objects in Sky View,
    a command is sent to put up a new browser window (konquerer by default) to
    fetch a page of information about the object from various web sites. It's
    quite nice. Thanks go to Tim Walker, twalker@bigpond.net.au.
    <i>Note: due to a server config beyond my control, the file name can not end with
    .pl so after downloading this file, please remove the "-removeme" portion.</i>

	<li><a href="M31globulars.edb">M31globulars.edb</a> is a list of
	principle globular clusters in galaxy M31.
	<li><a href="SMC.edb">SMC.edb</a> is a list of
	deep sky objects in the Magellanic Clouds.
	<li><a href="recons100.edb">recons100.edb</a> is the complete census
	as of January 1, 2000, of objects outside our solar system
	known within 10 parsecs.

    Looking for Motif? Here are prebuilt libraries and include files suitable
    for compiling XEphem from source on several systems. Right-click and
    Save the desired file, explode, and set the MOTIFI and MOTIFL macros
    in Makefile.smple in the XEphem source directory to point to the explode
    directory.

	<li><a href="linux-x86-motif-dev.tar.gz">Linux on x86</a>
	<li><a href="linux-alpha-motif-dev.tar.gz">Linux on Alpha</a>
	<li><a href="freebsd-motif-dev.tar.gz">FreeBSD on x86</a>
	<li><a href="osx-motif-dev.tar.gz">Mac OS X</a>
    </ul>

    Brandon Craig Rhodes has built an excellent astronomical Python library
    called
    <a target="PyEphem" href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/projects/pyephem.html">PyEphem</a>
    based on XEphem's libraries. Even if you don't use Python check it out,
    it's enough to make you switch.

    <p><li>
    XEphem runs very well under Windows using virtualization technologies such as
    <a target="vbox" href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>. You
    will need to load a linux distribution such as
    <a target="ubuntu" href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>.

    <p><li>
    Here are four .fav files of favorite NGC objects for each season of the
    year. Contributed by the late Guillermo Andrade, database contributor
    <em>par excellent</em>.
    <ul>
	<li><a target="summer" href="RASC_NGC_SUMMER.fav">Summer</a>
	<li><a target="autumn" href="RASC_NGC_AUTUMN.fav">Autumn</a>
	<li><a target="winter" href="RASC_NGC_WINTER.fav">Winter</a>
	<li><a target="spring" href="RASC_NGC_SPRING.fav">Spring</a>
    </ul>

    Here are two more Constellation Figures files inspired by popular sky
    atlases used in Germany and England:
    <a target='eurofigs_de' href='eurofigs_de.csf'>eurofigs_de.csf</a>
    and
    <a target='eurofigs_uk' href='eurofigs_uk.csf'>eurofigs_uk.csf</a>
    Put them in your shared or private XEphem directory and it will
    automatically become available as a choice in the Sky View -&gt; Options
    -&gt; Constellation menu. Contributed by Georg Graf, georg.graf at gmx.de.

    Bob Abraham has contributed an alterate image of Mars. It is made from
    observations from Earth and so more closely matches what a visual observer
    sees at the telescope than the Mars Orbiter map included with XEphem. The
    image is not perfectly registered with the Martian coordinate system of
    database objects but it is close enough for many purposes. Please see his
    <a target="vismars" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xephem/message/1933?threaded=1">forum posting</a>
    for full details and to download the final image. To use the image in
    XEphem, first save your current Mars map in
    <code>ShareDir/auxil/marsmap.jpg</code> somewhere then copy in Bob's
    image. Thanks Bob, this is a great idea.
