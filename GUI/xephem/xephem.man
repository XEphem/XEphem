XEphem is an interactive astronomical ephemeris program for the X Window System.
It provides many graphical views as well as quantitative heliocentric,
geocentric and topocentric information for Earth satellites, solar system
and celestial objects.

XEphem primarily uses two directories at runtime. One is referred to as the
Shared directory, the other as the Private directory. Shared is read-only and
holds supporting files that can be shared among all users on a system. Private
is writable and one is expected to exist for each user. See the section
below on X Resources for more information about defining these directories.

XEphem contains extensive context-sensitive on-line help. Virtually none of
that help is duplicated here so go ahead and run XEphem to learn more. The first
thing to do once XEphem is up is configure the browser interface. All of
XEphem help is written in html and stored in a file named xephem.html. The
first entry in the Help menu brings up a table of browsers and defines a command
for each that will invoke the browser and pass it the URL and anchor of the
text to display. XEphem comes configured to support several different
browsers. If yours is listed, just click the button to its left and your help
system should be working. If your browser is not listed, please check the FAQ
for the latest news.

Note that if you are running XEphem under cygwin on Windows, before starting
XEphem set an environment variable XEHELPURL to the full path of the
xephem.html file on your system using Windows path syntax (not cygwin paths).
This file is in the 
.I help
directory within the source directory of the master distribution.
After this is in the place, run xephem and it can use MS IE to display help.

The XEphem
.I Main window
is the master panel for setting up observing circumstances, time looping, and
for accessing all the additional tools and displays.
Observing circumstances includes location, date, time, local magnetic deviation
and atmospheric conditions (used for the refraction model).
Looping provides the ability to
set up XEphem so that it automatically increments time at a desired step size
and rate. Additional displays provide all of the graphical and quantitative
information available, which are always computed with respect to the
circumstances defined in the Main menu. Tools provide access to plotting,
searching, AAVSO and much more.

.SH Command line Options
.B -prfb
displays all the built-in default resources, then exits. Some of them are
described here.

.B -install
controls whether XEphem will install a private colormap. Without this option
XEphem will try to decide automatically whether it is necessary. To force
using a private colormap, use 
.I -install yes.
To prevent it, use
.I -install no.
The default automatic behavior is equivalent to
.I -install guess.

.B -resfile <resourcefile>
tells XEphem to use an alternate file for initial resource settings. See below
for the default situation.

.B -splash
or
.B -nosplash
controls whether XEphem will display a progress window front and center while it is
coming up. The choice is yours because this can be a useful sign of life on a
slow system, or be the source of an annoying flash on a fast system. The setting
is persistent so it will remain until changed.

.SH Menu Tour
.B File

This menu controls access to the System log;
setting up network access; accessing the gallery;
displaying a progress meter; controlling time and location information
remotely; and keyboard accelerators for time stepping.

.B View

This menu offers several graphical displays if the Sun, Earth, Moon and several
planets; a user configurable data table; and Sky and Solar System views.

.B Tools

This menu gives access to tools which can plot any XEphem
data items; save any data items to text files for easy export to other
programs; enter an arbitrary function to evaluate and solve using any 
XEphem data items; access AAVSO online; show the Night at a glance; find close
pairs of objects; convert among various astonomical coordinate systems; and a
handy log for taking observing notes.

.B Data

This menu gives control over which objects XEphem will work with.
Objects may be created on the fly, read from catalog files, downloaded
from the Internet, deleted or searched. A special category of objects known as
.I Field Stars
may be configured, which are very large catalogs of objects whose access
has been optimized. Any number of
.I Favorite
objects may be defined for especially
easy access in several other places throughout XEphem.

.B Preferences

This menu offers several configuration choices and tools for changing fonts
and colors used throughout XEphem.
These choices can be changed at runtime and saved to disk to become the new defaults.

.B Help

This menu offers overall information about XEphem;
context sensitive help;
references; version number and the Copyright statement.

.SH X Resources
When first started, XEphem looks for a file named
.B .xephemrc
in your $HOME directory. It should contain one line of the form:

XEphem.PrivateDir: ~/.xephem

This defines the Private directory, where XEphem will store your personal
settings. The example line shown here, which is also the assumption if the
file is not present, means XEphem will create and use a directory named
.B .xephem
for this purpose in your home directory.

Within this directory a text file named
.B XEphem
will contain all the Preferences that differ from those built in. One
important entry defines the Shared directory. This is in intended for
multi-user installations. XEphem looks here for support files. Unless
defined otherwise, the Shared directory is ".", that is, the current 
directory.
