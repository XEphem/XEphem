# convert MPCORB.DAT to 2 .edb files.
# Usage: [-f] <base>
#   if -f then use curl to get the script from harvard, else read it from stdin.
#   <base> is a prefix used in naming the generated .edb files.
# Two files are created:
#   <base>.edb contains only those asteroids which might ever be brighter
#      than $dimmag (set below);
#   <base>_dim.edb contains the remaining asteroids.

# mpcorb.dat is a service of the Minor Planet Center,

#    This file contains published orbital elements for  all  numbered  and
#    unnumbered multi-opposition minor planets for which it is possible to
#    make reasonable predictions.  It also includes published elements for
#    recent one-opposition  minor planets  and is  intended to be complete
#    through the last issued  Daily Orbit  Update  MPEC.  As  such  it  is
#    intended to be of interest primarily to astrometric observers.
#
#    Software programs may include this datafile amongst their datasets,as
#    long as this header is included (it is acceptable if it is  contained
#    in a file separate from the actual data) and that proper  attribution
#    to the Minor Planet Center is given.  Credit to the  individual orbit
#    computers is implicit by the inclusion of a reference and the name of
#    the orbit computer on each orbit record. Information on how to obtain
#    updated copies of the datafile must also be included.
#
#    The work of the individual astrometric observers,without whom none of
#    the work of the Minor Planet Center would be possible, is  gratefully
#    acknowledged.
#
#    New versions of this file, updated on a daily basis,will be available
#    at: https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/MPCORB/MPCORB.DAT
#    These  files  are  rebuilt  each  night,  generally between 02:00 and
#    03:00 EST  (07:00  and 08:00 UT), except during the short period each
#    month  when  the  next  batch  of   Minor  Planet Circulars are being
#    prepared.
