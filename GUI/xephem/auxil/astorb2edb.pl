#                 The Lowell Asteroid Orbital Elements Database
# ================================================================================
# Introduction
#       astorb.dat is an ASCII file of high-precision osculating orbital elements,
# ephemeris uncertainties, and some additional data for all the numbered asteroids
# and the vast majority of  unnumbered  asteroids (multi-apparition and single-ap-
# parition) for which it is possible to make reasonably determinate computations.
#       It is currently about 1.7 Mb in size in its compressed form(astorb.dat.gz)
# 6.3 Mb in  size when  decompressed  (astorb.dat),  and  contains  237215  orbits
# computed by me (Edward Bowell).  Each  orbit,  based on astrometric observations
# downloaded from the Minor Planet Center, occupies one 266-column record.
#
#                          Special Features of astorb.dat
#       There are three primary differences between our  database and conventional
# asteroid orbit files.
#       First, we update the database daily. Thus,  observations in each new batch
# of Minor Planet Circulars will be used in new  orbits on a  monthly  basis,  and
# those in the Minor Planet Electronic Circulars shortly after they are published.
# Other changes, such as the addition of orbits resulting from our own astrometric
# observations  and the computation of current ephemeris uncertainties, are  being
# made  on  a  quasi-daily basis. Automatic daily updates commence at 8 hr UT. The
# updating  process  is  generally  completed  by 10:00 UT. On the UT date of full
# Moon, the updating process is not completed until 14 hr UT or later.
#
#       Second,  all  the  orbits  in a given version of the file have an epoch of
# osculation near the  present.  Consequently,  the ephemerides of most non-Earth-
# -approaching asteroids can be computed to  arcsec accuracy or better within ± 50
# days of the epoch using a 2-body ephemeris program.
#
#       Third, current and future ephemeris uncertainties are given.Observers will
# readily be able to  estimate  whether  asteroids are likely  to  be within their
# telescopes' fields  of  view,  and  they  will  better  be  able  to  prioritize
# astrometric targets.
