<p>XEphem is a scientific-grade interactive astronomical ephemeris
package. XEphem:</p>
<ul>
  <li>computes <span style="font-weight: bold;">heliocentric,
geocentric and topocentric</span> information for all objects;</li>
  <li>has built-in support for all <span style="font-weight: bold;">planets;
the moons</span> of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Earth; central
meridian longitude of Mars and Jupiter; Saturn's <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">rings;</span> and Jupiter's <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Great Red Spot</span>;</li>
  <li>allows <span style="font-weight: bold;">user-defined objects</span>
including stars, deepsky objects, asteroids, comets and Earth
satellites.</li>
  <li>provides special efficient handling of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">large catalogs</span> including Tycho,
Hipparcos, GSC.<br>
  </li>
  <li>displays data in <span style="font-weight: bold;">configurable
tabular formats</span> in conjunction with several interactive
graphical views;</li>
  <li>displays a <span style="font-weight: bold;">night-at-a-glance</span>
24 hour graphic showing when any selected objects are up;</li>
  <li>displays <span style="font-weight: bold;">3-D stereo Solar
System views</span> that are particularly well suited for visualizing
comet trajectories;</li>
  <li>quickly <span style="font-weight: bold;">finds all close pairs</span>
of objects in the sky;</li>
  <li>sorts and prints all catalogs with very flexible criteria for
creating custom <span style="font-weight: bold;">observing lists</span>;</li>
  <li>creates <span style="font-weight: bold;">plots of any pairs</span>
of all data fields throughout the program;</li>
  <li>downloads <span style="font-weight: bold;">current asteroid and
comets</span> ephemerides from Lowell Observatory and Minor Planet
Center;</li>
  <li>downloads timely <span style="font-weight: bold;">Earth satellite</span>
orbital TLE parameters;</li>
  <li>plots true <b>binary system</b> orbits;<br>
  </li>
  <li>downloads <span style="font-weight: bold;">Digitized Sky Survey</span>
FITS files from STScI or ESO;</li>
  <li>provides a handy <span style="font-weight: bold;">coordinates</span>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">spreadsheet</span> for converting
among
equatorial, ecliptic, horizon and galactic frames ;</li>
  <li>displays live SOHO images of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sun</span>;<br>
  </li>
  <li>includes a compiler for entering and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">solving user-written functions</span> using
any data fields;</li>

XEphem can compute information on demand or time can be set to
increment automatically. In this way a series of computations and
movies can be generated.<br>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId605914"></a> 1.1 Quantitative
information</h2>
<p>Quantitative information available about each object includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>RA and Dec,</li>
  <li>local azimuth and altitude,</li>
  <li>distance from sun and earth,</li>
  <li>light travel times,</li>
  <li>heliocentric coordinates,</li>
  <li>galactic coordinates,</li>
  <li>ecliptic coordinates,</li>
  <li>solar elongation,</li>
  <li>angular size,</li>
  <li>visual magnitude,</li>
  <li>illumination percentage,</li>
  <li>local rise and set times and azimuths,</li>
  <li>local transit times and altitude,</li>
  <li>length of time up,</li>
  <li>constellation,</li>
  <li>angular separations between all Favorites.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId391132"></a> 1.2 Local circumstances</h2>
<p>Local observing circumstance information includes</p>
<ul>
  <li>UTC and local date and time,</li>
  <li>local sidereal time,</li>
  <li>times astronomical, nautical and civil twilight and length of
night,</li>
  <li>local temperature and pressure (for refraction),</li>
  <li>elevation above sea level (for parallax),</li>
  <li>a monthly calendar.</li>
</ul>
Equatorial coordinates may be computed in any four combinations of
topocentric or geocentric, and apparent or astrometric. When the
Equinox is set to a fixed date the values are astrometric, that is,
corrected only for precession and light travel time. When the Equinox
is set for EOD (Equinox of Date) the values are apparent and are also
corrected for nutation, aberration and relativistic deflection.
Topocentric values are further corrected for parallax, augmentation
and refraction.<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId644691"></a> 1.3.1 <a
 name="SharedPrivateDirs"></a>Shared and Private Directories</h3>
When XEphem is launched it looks for a file named <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">.xephemrc</span> in the user's <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$HOME</span> directory. This file is
optional. If it exists, it should contain a line with the following
form:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family: monospace;">XEphem.PrivateDir:
~/.xephem</span> </div>
<br>
The directory named on the right is where XEphem will create and look
for <span style="font-style: italic;">Private</span> files, so-called
because on a multiuser system they are expected to be separated on a
per-user basis. A leading "~" in the file name can be used to refer to <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$HOME</span>, your login directory.
A leading "." in the file name can be used to refer to the current
working directory of the running program. The example above causes the
Private directory to be <span style="font-family: monospace;">.xephem</span>
in the users <span style="font-family: monospace;">$HOME</span>
directory. If <span style="font-family: monospace;">.xephemrc</span>
does not exist or does not contain this line the default Private
directory is <span style="font-family: monospace;">~/.xephem</span>.
The private directory will be created if it does not already exist.<br>
<br>
XEphem then also searches for another directory for <i>Shared</i>
files. This directory contains files presumed to be shared
among all XEphem users on a system. Files in this directory are never
modified by XEphem. They include databases of objects, supporting
images and other files. This directory is specified in a resource file
named <span style="font-family: monospace;">XEphem</span> which may be
located in any of the standard X Window&nbsp; System directories, in
/etc or within the Private directory (see above). It should contain a
line with the following form:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family: monospace;">XEphem.ShareDir:
/usr/local/xephem</span> </div>
<br>
Next, XEphem sets the initial values of most options and settings from
other entries in the resource file. Settings which do not appear will
use their internal default values. Internal defaults may be printed
using the -prfb command line option.<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId554195"></a> 1.3.2 Main window control</h3>
XEphem starts by showing the Main window with each parameter set to
its default value. The parameters on the Main window are primarily
devoted to describing the location and time for which all other data
in XEphem are computed.<br>
<br>
Most fields on the Main window may be changed by clicking them. A
prompt window with a brief explanation of the field will appear. A new
value may be typed into the text field provided. If <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Ok</span> is clicked the new value will be
used; if <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel</span> is clicked the
field will be left unchanged. In either case, the prompt window goes
away. Some of the windows have an extra button which offers a handy
way to enter frequently used values for the field.<br>
<br>
If you change a field on the Main window that would invalidate any of
the other fields in any XEphem window the message NEW CIRCUMSTANCES
flashes near the top of the Main window. This will continue until the
next Update occurs. If you change any field that causes new
circumstances, the Step value is not added to the current time before
the next loop.<br>
<br>
You can change time manually like any other fields or you can set up
looping to advance time automatically with specified pauses between
each step. The prominent button at the bottom of the Main window
labeled <span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span> causes all
other
windows throughout XEphem will be recomputed with the new time.
Looping effectively presses this button for you. See <a
 href="#main_looping">Looping</a>.<br>
<br>
Some graphical views have a push button marked <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Movie Demo</span>. This is a convenient way
to start and stop a sample movie sequence. If XEphem is currently idle
then pushing the button will set the Main window Step size to a value
that will yield a pleasing motion effect and start looping with a very
large number of steps. If XEphem is already looping then pushing the
button will cause it to stop and set Main window N Steps to 1. The
Main window Stop control can also stop the looping in the usual way.
<h2><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId40933"></a> 1.4  <a name="Date_time"></a>Time
and angle formats</h2>
Time and RA are displayed as h:m:s. They may be entered the same way
or the color (:) may be entered as slash (/) semicolor (;) comma (,)
or space. Other angular quantities, such as declination, azimuth,
altitude, longitude and latitude, are entered and displayed as d:m:s
but
otherwise use the same rules.<br>
<br>
Components of a sexagesimal field may be entered as floating point
numbers. For example 10:20:30 may also be entered as either 10:20.5 or
10.34167.<br>
<br>
Negative values are indicated by one hyphen (-) before the first
character.<br>
<br>
Dates are entered and displayed in any one of the forms month/day/year,
year/month/day or day/month/year, depending on the <a
 href="#MainMenu_preferences">Preferences</a> selection on the Main
menubar. The slash (/) may also be entered as hyphen (-) semicolon (;)
or comma (,). Note you must always enter the full year.<br>
<br>
When the day portion of a date is an integer, the time does not change.
When the day portion of a date is entered as a floating point number,
the time will also change to correspond to the fractional portion of
the day. For example, using the preference m/d/y, entering a date of
1/1.5/1995 will set the date to 1/1/1995 and the time to 12:00:00. To
get this effect with a whole day, include the decimal point. For
example, 1/1.0/2002 will set the date to 1/1/2002 and the time to
0:00:00.<br>
<br>
You may also enter a date as a decimal year, as in 1990.12345.<br>
<br>
Negative years indicate BC dates. For example, Jan 1, 1 BC is given
as 1/1/-1. Before you ask, yes, "1-1--1" works for 1 BC. There is no
year 0.

<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Julian</span> Number of days
since noon 4713 BC to about 1-second accuracy. Used as a uniform
time scale.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">UTC Date</span> The UTC date.
UTC is Universal Coordinated Time, the basis,after adjusting for
time zones, for the official "civil" time people set their clocks
to. Every year or so it is adjusted via a leap second so it stays
within 0.9 seconds of UT1, which varies continuously with the slight
irregularities of the rotational motion of the Earth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">UTC Time</span> The UTC time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sidereal</span> The apparent
sidereal time for the current time and location. Equals the apparent
RA at the local meridian.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">TZ Name</span> The local time
zone name. The name may be fixed to any short mnemonic. Setting this
manually turns off automatic computation of Daylight Savings Time.
When auto DST is on, a small clock is shown at the top right of the
Time section.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">TZ Offset</span> Hours local
time is behind UTC, i.e., positive west or negative east of
Greenwich. Setting this manually turns off automatic computation of
Daylight Savings Time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Local Date</span> The local
date. This is UTC date minus the value of TZ Offset.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Local Time</span> The local
time. This is UTC time minus the value of TZ Offset.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Delta T</span> TT-UT1. Number
of seconds by which Terrestrial Time (aka Ephemeris Time prior to
1982) leads UT1. TT is generally of interest when calculating the
positions of solar system objects because it is a continuous time
scale unaffected by the Earth's rotational vagaries. The term
Terrestrial means it is adjusted for the relativistic effects of
gravity and the Earth's revolution around the Sun. UT1 or UTC is of
interest when relating those positions to the horizon to produce
altitudes and azimuths. The value may be computed automatically
based on the current time or entered manually (in which case it will
not change). The algorithm uses values tabulated in the Astronomical
Almanac for years 1620.0 through 1998.0, and is accurate to within a
few seconds over that interval. Dates prior are from Stephenson and
Morrison or K. M. Borkowski, with an estimated error of 15 minutes at
1500 B.C. A linear extrapolation formula predicts future values.<br

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dusk</span> Local or UTC time
when the Sun center is Sun dip degrees below the horizon after sunset
today.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Length</span> Length of
astronomical night, i.e., Dawn - Dusk. If this and the display for
Dawn and Dusk are shown as "-----", it means the Sun is either
always below or always above Sun dip degrees below the horizon on
this particular day.</li>

<br>
N.B. These three fields always apply to the local current day.
Difficulties arise when these events occur within 4 minutes of local
midnight with respect to the time zone defined by TZ Offset. In
particular, if these fields are not behaving as you would expect,
check that the TZ Offset is set commensurate with the current

The Gallery database index is stored in one or more files with the
suffix <b>.gly</b>. The index files and the image files to which they
refer reside in a directory named <b>gallery</b> which in turn must
reside within either the <a href="#SharedPrivateDirs">Shared or Private</a>
directories. All index files found are combined and sorted by name into
the scrolled list.<br>
<br>
The index file is in XML format. The entire collection is within one
outer-most element named <tt>gallery</tt>. In turn it contains one
element named <tt>image</tt> for each
Gallery image file.
In turn it contains one or more elements named <tt>name</tt>, one
element named <tt>file</tt> and one element named <tt>description</tt>.
The file name is with respect to the directory in which the .gly file
resides. When XEphem reads the description contents, it replaces
isolated newlines with blanks so that word wrapping is left up to the
scrolled text window. Please refer to the following example.<br>

Section two controls information related to rising, transitting, and
setting. These are computed based on a refraction model that uses the
actual atmospheric and topocentric circumstances displayed on the Main
window. A text entry field is available in which you may specify a
number of decimal degrees the local horizon is above horizontal to
account for local effects.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Limb</span> option means that
the rise and set circumstances are based on the location of the upper
limb of the object. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Center</span>
means
that the circumstances are based on the location of the center of the
object.<br>
<br>
Follows is a description of the Data Table columns controlled by the
second Data Selection section:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">RisTm</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">RisAz</span> The local or UTC time and
azimuth when the upper limb (or center) of the object rises Today.
See note below for Earth satellites.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">TrnTm</span>,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TrnAlt</span> and
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TrnAz</span>
For all but Earth
satellites, this is the local or UTC time, altitude and azimuth when
the object crosses the meridian Today or, if no precession, when the
local sidereal time equals the object's right ascension.
If the object is an Earth satellite, this is the next time, highest
altitude and corresponding azimuth the satellite ever reaches above the local
horizon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">SetTm</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">SetAz</span> The local or UTC time and
azimuth when the upper limb (or center) of the object sets Today.
See note below for Earth satellites.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">HrsUp</span> The number of hours
the object is up Today, that is, the difference between the set and
rise times. See note below for Earth satellites.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Note for time zones:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Rise and set circumstances are all
computed in local time. If the Zone Display preference (from the
Main menubar) is set to UTC then the times are converted to UTC.
Thus, when reference is made to Today it means the current local
date, not UTC date. </div>
<br>
Note for Earth satellites:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Due to their generally rapid motions
Earth satellites often have many rising and setting events per day.
For this reason, the rise and set time for satellites are not
restrained to be during the current local day. Rather, for
satellites, XEphem displays the very next rising and setting events
that occur strictly later than the current time on the Main window,
provided they occur within 24 hours. This means that if the rise or
set time displayed is earlier than the current local time on the
Main window, it actually refers to the next day. This doesn't happen
for the other objects because their times are restricted to events
that happen just today. Similarly, we can only compute the HrsUp
column if the set time is strictly later than the rise time.<br>
<br>
The upshot of all this is that the best way to really understand
the visibility of a satellite in your area is by graphing its
altitude over the desired time interval, or displaying all its
passes in the Night-at-a-Glance tool. </div>
<br>
Various odd ball rising, transit and setting conditions are accounted
for and marked when they occur as in the following table. Note that in
the case of Earth satellites, "Today" really means within the next 24
hours.<br>

<br>
The third section in the Data Table setup window lists the current
set of <a href="#Favorites">Favorites</a>. Any one may be selected
for which the angular separation between it and the object on that row
will be shown, in degrees.<br>
<br>
The vantage point for the Separation values depends on the Equatorial <a
 href="#MainMenu_preferences">preference</a> in the Main window.
Geocentric ignores local conditions and gives the separation as seen
from Earth center. Topocentric uses the local conditions known to
XEphem. The choice is particularly critical for lunar occultations and
Earth satellites, of course, but the effect can be significant for the
planets as well. Geocentric separations between objects and the Sun
will match the magnitude of the elongation given in the Data Table
window.<br>
<br>
Note:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Solving over a period that will
include
the rise or set times of either object is generally better performed
from the geocentric viewpoint. The refraction effect of the
topocentric viewpoint causes many arc minutes of rapid whiplash
displacement as the objects rise and set that overlays the smooth
celestial motion of the objects. This rapid position variation can
confuse the solver algorithms that expect fairly smooth functions.<br>

extraordinary data is courtesy of the SOHO consortium. SOHO is a
project
of international cooperation between ESA and NASA.<br>
<br>
The SOHO data is pulled from the web site

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId591361"></a> 4.2.1 Sun mouse</h3>
Moving the mouse over a loaded SOHO image will display the approximate
RA and Dec under the cursor. To do this XEphem makes an assumption
about
the scale and orientation of the image and defines the center of the
image as the position of the sun computed at the current XEphem time.
However, we have found SOHO images are not always oriented the same way
and we are not aware of a means to know the orientation
programmatically
so beware. The Carrington Rotation Number is shown in the lower right,
also as of the current XEphem time. If XEphem time differs from when
the
SOHO image was acquired the coordinates will still be correct but of
course the solar features shown in the image will not be correct. <br>
<br>
Note that the coordinates do not take account of the different
perspective from the SOHO spacecraft. SOHO does not wander far from the
Sun-Earth line so images of the sun itself do not suffer much but this
effect is quite pronounced for Large Angle and Spectrometric
Coronagraph
images where the coordinates of background objects may be off by a
degree or more. Again, beware and check all coordinates independently
for important work.<br>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId427392"></a> 4.3 Moon</h2>
<img src="png/moon.png" alt="" align="right" height="350" hspace="10"
 vspace="10" width="511">This
is
an image of the Moon, shaded to indicate phase. It may be flipped and
scaled as desired and many Lunar features may be labeled, including
most spacecraft landing sites. During a Lunar eclipse, the edges of
the umbra and penumbra regions are drawn as solid and dashed lines,
respectively.<br>
<br>
The coordinate system on the Moon is such that latitude increases
towards the north and longitude increases towards the east. When facing
the Moon with the unaided eye, lunar east is towards the right. The
lunar image in XEphem is oriented with the polar axis vertical on the
screen. Letters are placed at each edge of the image to show lunar
coordinate directions.<br>
<br>
The scrolling list on the right lists all features in the data base.
Clicking on a name will toggle its label on the map. The labels are
positioned so the center of the feature is at the lower left corner of
the label string. If the label is being turned on then the Labels View
option is also turned on if it is off.
Double-clicking will display the set of Lunar Orbiter images that
include the feature.<br>
<br>
The Moon nods and rocks slightly as it moves through the sky. This
motion is called libration. A dot is placed on the circumference of
the image to indicate the limb position that is currently tilted most
towards Earth due to libration. The angular position of the dot is
placed accurately but the image rendering is not adjusted for
libration effects. Thus, the surface features over which the dot and
the terminator appear in the image are only approximate.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Left button</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Activating the left mouse button while
over the lunar image will display a small magnified 2x view of the
lunar surface under the cursor. The magnified image will track the
cursor as it is moved around the image. The latitude, longitude and
solar altitude of the location are displayed in the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">More info...</span> window. </div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Right button</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Activating the right mouse button while
over the lunar image will display a popup menu. It lists the name of
the
feature nearest to the cursor, the type, lunar coordinates and the
altitude of the sun as seen from that feature at the current XEphem
time. A toggle button <span style="font-weight: bold;">Label</span>
turns on or off a label on the map. A
pushbutton <span style="font-weight: bold;">Set info table</span>
loads the feature into the More info window and
will display window if it is not already up. If the Lunar Orbiter
database has been loaded, then a pushbutton <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Lunar Orbiter image</span> displays the
image in which this feature lies, and also turns on the feature's label
on the main map for handy reference.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Activating the right mouse button
while
not over the lunar image but near a sky background object will pop
up a menu containing the name and magnitude of the object. There
will also be a button <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add to favorites</span>
to assign the object to your <a href="#Favorites">Favorites</a>.</div>
<br>
The two features may be activated together if desired by first pressing
the left button then the right button. This is helpful when trying to
locate a particular feature in the magnified view. Try to always
release the right button to dismiss the popup before releasing the
left button. If you release the left button first, the magnifying
glass will remain on the image. If you run into this, you can activate

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This brings up a window containing a
scale which allows you to set how bright the Earthshine is in the
Moon image. The value ranges from 0, black, to 10, full sun light.
Full sun light is useful when you would like to peruse the Lunar
surface but would rather not change the XEphem date to a full Moon.<br>
<br>
This value depends on the gamma of your display. A fine discussion
of display gamma and a test image with which you can determine the
gamma value of your own display may be found at the URL: <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This brings up a separate window with
additional information. The top portion of the window reports the
location of the cursor as it is moved over the image, if the left

times when the Sun will next rise and set at that location. The times
are in accord with the Time zone <a href="#MainMenu_preferences">Preferences</a>
in the Main window.<br>
<br>
The lower portion of the window shows the lunar longitude of sunrise,
the lunar latitude of the subsolar point, and libration information.
The longitude of the subsolar point is at +90 from the sunrise
longitude, and the longitude of the anti-subsolar point is at -90.
The libration in longitude is positive towards lunar east; latitude
is positive towards lunar north. The Limb angle is zero at lunar
north and increases towards lunar west. The Tilt is the number of
degrees the Moon is tilted towards Earth around an axis defined by
the librations in latitude and longitude. The limb location that is
tilted most towards Earth is indicated on the image by a small dot.<br>
<br>
Any of the values in the lower portion may be <a href="#Plot">plotted,</a>

taken by Lunar
Orbiter IV in 1967. These images and the features database are used by
permission of
the Lunar and Planetary Institute.<br>
<br>
Lunar Orbiter images are located in the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">lo</span> directory within the Shared
directory. When these images are installed they are accessible from the
Moon view in two ways. One is to double-click an entry in the features
list down the right of the Moon view window. The other is to use the
Lunar Orbiter images button in the popup over the image in the main
Moon window.&nbsp; These functions are automatically disabled if XEphem
can not fund the images on startup.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The LO images are displayed in their own window. The images are large
so panning controls are available on the bottom and right edges. The
annotation
overlay may be toggled on and off with the given toggle button. A
scrolled list in the lower right corner allows choosing one from among
all the LO images which contain the current feature.<br>
<br>
The LO images are not perfectly aligned NSEW, some are canted as much
as 30 degrees from vertical. The images are shown exactly as they were
taken. No attempt is made to register the images with the main
XEphem moon view, nor to perform flipping or scaling. The ability to
click to see the next adjacent image would have been nice but certain
technical difficulties made the results unsatisfactory and was left
out.<br>

outlines or a real color image. The night side may be dark or include
nightside lights. The projection may be spherical or
cylindrical "Mission Control" style. The controls available from the
menu bar across the top control the view, the display of additional
information and
the ability to overlay the ground positions of all Favorite objects.
The scales along the bottom and right edges display, and may be used
to control, the center longitude and latitude location. The button in
the lower right corner sets the latitude to exactly zero. The scale
along the left edge sets the zoom.<br>
<br>
Any or all of the current <a href="#Favorites">Favorites</a> may be

If a solar eclipse is occurring on the Earth a small X will mark the
location of central totality. Try July 11, 1991 around 18:00 UT or May

All computations for Earth satellites are based on the NORAD SGP4/SDP4
code. This code produces the exact same output as their test
collection.
This means, however, that it is not integrated particularly tightly
with
the rest of XEphem. For example, its computations use a different model
for Earth flattening and for refraction. These and other differences
can
lead to modest inconsistencies. <a name="Earth_mouse"></a>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Displays the entire Earth surface
projected onto a cylinder. Primary advantage is the entire surface
is visible at once. Particularly good for plotting satellite ground
tracks. Major disadvantage is distortion near the poles. The
preferred width-to-height ratio for the cylindrical projection is
3.14:1. This ratio is enforced each time this projection is selected by
changing the width and maintaining the current window height, subject
to
remaining fully on screen. </div>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Spherical graphic<br>
Spherical image<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Displays the Earth as it would really
appear from space. The primary advantage is the sense of reality and
lack of distortion. Either projection may be shown using a simple
graphical technique which draws only the outlines of the major land
features, or using a full color image, courtesy NASA's project Blue
Marble. The former is fast, the latter looks much better. The spherical
projection resizes to become a square by setting the width equal to the

It is updated once every six hours. All other graphical features of
the Earth view remain available as overlays to this image. Primary
advantage is ease in determining whether weather will effect
visibility of a satellite pass. If you have trouble accessing the
image directly from XEphem, the program will also use the file
/tmp/latest_cmoll.gif if it exists. The weather map forces itself to
become 640x480 pixels.<br>

drawn on the map. Craters and single Mountains are drawn with a circle
to scale, landing sites with a small circle and other categories are
just labeled by name.<br>
<br>
Click an entry in the scrolled list to turn it on or off individually.
Or select features by category by clicking the toggle buttons down the
left and possibly <b>Toggle, All</b><b></b> and <b>None</b> as
convenient, then clicking <b>Apply</b>. <b>Ok</b> does the same but
also closes this window.<br>
<br>
As a special case if everything in the scrolled list is unselected and
one feature is selected, the map will be rotated to place the selected
feature in the center. This is handy for locating a feature by name.
Note that all features may be deselected easily by clicking <b>None</b><b></b>

<h3><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId474567"></a> 4.9.1 Solar System Scales</h3>
The three scales at the edges control the position of the observer.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The vertical scale on the <span

Sun. You are closer as the scale is slid further up. You can also
control this with the keypad + and - keys. Using the key alone moves
by 2% little, with Shift moves by 10%. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The horizontal scale across the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">bottom</span> of the view controls the
heliocentric longitude. Think of it as a rotation about the central
axis. The value of the scale is the heliocentric longitude vector
pointing straight at you. You can also control this with the keypad
Left and Right arrow keys. Using the key alone moves by 2%, with
Shift moves 10%. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The vertical scale on the <span

latitude, your angle above or below the ecliptic plane. You can also
control this with the keypad Up and Down arrow keys. Using the key
alone moves by 2%, with Shift moves 10%. </div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This button will bring up a window to
set up making a trail for each object as they travel from their
current positions. Each trail time is drawn connected together with
a solid line with each point indicated with a small dot. The time
stamps shown with the trails, if any, are always in UTC. For the
trail to be visible, the Trails option must be activated. Only one
set of trails is supported at a time. Creating new trails will
delete the old ones. The trails will also be discarded if a user
defined
object is changed or an Update occurs from the Main window. Only the
Favorites are trailed. The other solar system objects, if any, are

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Live Dragging</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This toggle button selects whether the
graphics are redrawn in real time as the various scale controls are
being slid, or whether the graphics are not redrawn until the mouse
is released. The response depends on the speed of the computer, display
and data bandwidth. If the system is fast enough, turning this on
can produce dramatic depth clues for complex solar system views;
also try it in Stereo. </div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Stereo pair</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This toggle button is used to bring up
another image of the solar system from a slightly displaced vantage
point. Adjusting your gaze to fuse the two images together will
reveal a 3D image. This effect is most pronounced if fairly lengthy
trails are created, legs are turned on and the Ecliptic plane circles
are turned off. This effect was designed
primarily to help visualize the orbits of comets. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> At the bottom of the stereo display is
a scale to control the amount of parallax to introduce. The parallax
is only introduced in the plane of the ecliptic. This works well for
low latitudes but when viewing from near the poles it just moves
everything equally.<br>
<br>
If you prefer focusing your eyes in front of the screen, move the
parallax control somewhat to the left; if you prefer to relax your
eyes and focus at infinity then move the parallax control to the
right. You can also control this scale with the keypad slash (/) and
star (*) keys. </div>

<h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId792513"></a> 5.0 Sky View</h1>
<img style="width: 497px; height: 498px;" alt="" title=""
 src="png/sky-view.png" align="right" hspace="20"> This view presents a
schematic representation of the sky showing database
objects and useful auxiliary information. A FITS file image can also
be displayed simultaneously.<br>
<br>
The dominant center area displays each object that meets the brightness
and type filter selection criteria. Objects with defined date ranges
are
only shown at valid times. A menu bar across the top offers access to
all functions. Fast access to certain functions are available from the
surrounding toolbars. The mouse buttons can be used inside the display
area for additional functionality specific to the exact location of
the cursor when clicked.<br>
<br>
Note that while <a href="#main_looping">looping</a> with Pause set to
0 the Sky View is not updated (although all quantitative information
is always updated internally each step). This is to permit creating
plots and using other XEphem features that use many time increments to
run much more quickly if the Sky View is unmanaged or with Pause set
to 0.<br>
<br>
If the object is an Earth satellite, its label will be surrounded in
parentheses if it eclipsed at that location.

<a name="SkyView_mouse"></a>
<h2><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId692938"></a> 5.1 Sky View mouse</h2>
The mouse serves many purposes in the Sky View. Exactly what it does
at any one time depends on whether it is located over an object and on
the states of some of the toolbar buttons.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">No buttons:</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><img
 alt="" src="png/sky-upperleft-roaming.png" align="left" height="60"
 hspace="20" width="177"></span><img style="width: 101px; height: 57px;"
 alt="" title="" src="png/sky-upperright-roaming.png" align="right"
 hspace="20">Generally
nothing happens when the mouse is over the Sky View and no buttons
are being pressed. However, if the Corner Coordinates toolbar button
(upper right) is On, basic data describing the position of the
cursor are displayed in the upper corners whenever the cursor is
over the Sky even when no buttons are depressed. These data include: </div>
<br clear="all">
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the Upper left corner:</span><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li>RA, Dec and Hour angle equatorial coordinates;</li>
  <li>the great-circle distance and bearing between the current
position and the
point at which the left button was last clicked;</li>
  <li>constellation name;</li>
  <li>if displaying FITS image, raw image pixel coordinates. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">N.B. FITS coords = XEphem coords + 1</span><br
 clear="all">
  </li>
</ul>
<ul style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li>In the Upper right corner:</li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li>Alt, Az and Zenith horizon coordinates;</li>
  <li>Galactic latitude and longitude<br clear="all">
  <li>Parallactic angle, +/-180 +west<br clear="all">
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The coordinates are derived directly
from the screen location and know nothing of the displayed objects.
Thus, they neglect parallax (i.e., assume everything is at infinity).<br>
<br>
If the Telescope Marker is active and a telescope control process
is reporting telescope position information, then when the cursor is
outside the Sky View the data in the corners refer to the telescope
marker position, not the cursor position. This information is not
displayed if any keyboard keys or mouse buttons are pressed. </div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Left button:</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img
 style="width: 99px; height: 57px;" alt="" title=""
 src="png/sky-upperright-delta-roaming.png" align="right" hspace="20"><img
 alt="" src="png/sky-upperleft-delta-roaming.png" align="left"
 height="64" hspace="20" width="177">If
the
Region of Interest toolbar button is On and the left mouse button is
pressed, then the information in the upper left and right corners
changes into delta information, that is, the changes in the various
coordinates with respect to the position where the left button was
last pressed. </div>
<br clear="all">
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> If the ROI toolbar button is On,
pressing and dragging the left mouse button draws a Region of
Interest box. This ROI can serve two roles. One is a way to zoom.
With the ROI toolbar button On, click in the Sky View with the left
mouse button and begin to draw a box surrounding a region of
interest. When the button is released, the ROI becomes fixed into
position. To perform the zoom, press Zoom In in the tool bar. The
current size, position, and ROI are saved and the Sky View is
changed to expand the new area. The Zoom Back tool bar button then
becomes available to restore the display to its previous size and
position. The Zoom In and Zoom Back buttons work as a pair for
arbitrary
levels of undo and redo. This Zooming is implemented by actually
sliding the scales around the edges of the Sky View just as if you
had done it manually. Thus, the selected area may be rotated after
the zoom due to a change in perspective in the map projection. This
is a feature. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The other use for the ROI is available
only when an image is being display. Basic statistics are computed
for the pixels that lie within the ROI box. Also only while an image
is displayed, the left mouse button may be used to position a
Magnifying
glass; graph the pixels along an arbitrary cross sectional slice
through
the image; and compute and display high quality photometric and
astrometric information about the star nearest the cursor based on 2D
Gaussian fitting. See <a href="#SkyIP">Image analysis</a>. </div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Middle button:</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> While the middle button is depressed,
the cursor is changed to a fleur pattern. Moving the mouse left and
right is like moving the scale at the bottom; moving it up and down
is like moving the scale at the right. This provides a simple method
to pan the display. This feature is not yet available while
displaying an image. If the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Live
dragging</span> option is turned on (see <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Control &raquo; Options</span>), the
panning occurs immediately. If this is painfully slow on your system
then turn this off so the screen is only redrawn one time when the
button is released. </div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Sky_view_popup_right_button"></a>Right
button:</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img alt=""
 src="png/sky-popup-menu.png" align="right" height="297" hspace="20"
 width="146">If
the right button is clicked over the
Sky View,
then a popup menu will appear. If the button is clicked and
released, the menu will stay up and can be used like any other menu.
Or the button may be pressed and held while you slide the cursor to
the desired button and let go. Try both and use whichever procedure you
prefer. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The popup contains information and
controls germane to the exact position of the cursor when the button
was clicked. The entries in the popup menu vary depending on whether
the cursor was near an object or over empty sky. If the cursor is
near a object, data is shown which are exactly the same as that
which is available in the <a href="#Data_Table">Data Table</a> window.
If a trailed object is selected, the data applies at the
time for that position. If the cursor was not near an object, basic
information based on the location of the cursor itself is shown. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The popup also offers several control
operations, as follows. Remember, only the ones relevant to the
current situation and toolbar choices will appear.<br>
<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li><b>Name</b> will show the name of the object. If alternate names
are available they will be displayed in a pullright cascade menu.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Type</b> will display a brief description of the type of
object.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Center</span> will change the
Sky View pointing direction to place the given object (or location)
at the center of the field of view.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Center + Zoom</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&raquo; </span>is like
Center but will also zoom in or out the amount selected in the
pullright cascade menu.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Persistent Label &raquo; on
Left on Right</span> will toggle whether a label is drawn on the left
or right side of the current object. The label will consist of the
name and/or the magnitude, depending on which options are selected
in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">SkyView &raquo; Options</span>
Labeling section. If neither are selected, the label will consist of
the name. Persistent labels are always on, that is, they are not
subject to magnitude limits, options, or object type filtering. Note
this option is maintained separately for trailed objects and for the
untrailed objects; that is, you have independent control over
labeling for a trailed object and its currently displayed object
since the latter also always appears in the trailed list. This can
be somewhat confusing for trails which begin Now since, in effect,
the first item is drawn twice (once just because it is an object
like any other, and again as a member of the set of trail history
points).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Place eyepiece</span> will cause
an eyepiece symbol to be drawn centered under the mouse location. The
eyepiece shape and size are defined in the Eyepiece Setup window,
available at <span style="font-family: monospace;">Control &raquo;
Eyepieces</span>. Both the RA-Dec and Alt-Az of the location are
saved and the one matching the Display mode is used when the
eyepiece is drawn on the Sky View. In this way eyepieces can be
fixed in either coordinate system. See <a href="#SkyView_eyepieces">Eyepieces</a>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete eyepiece</span> will
delete the closest eyepiece covering this mouse location. The search
algorithm uses the smaller of the two dimensions of the eyepiece so
it may be necessary to get close to the center depending on the shape.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Telescope GoTo</span> will cause
the coordinates of the cursor to be sent to the INDI telescope control
process. The command is not issued if the coordinates are below the
horizon. This button is only present if the connected process is
running. See <a href="#SkyView_telescope">Telescope.</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Add to logbook</span> will copy
pertinent position and descriptive information about the current object
to a new entry in the <a href="#obslog">Observers logbook</a>. This
selection only appears if the logbook tool window is currently open.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Photom ref</span> only
appears if an image is being displayed, the 2D Gaussian image analysis
tool is up, and the cursor was clicked near a database object. If all
this is so, then said object is used as the new reference for
photometric comparisons, and the magnitude of the object from the
database is set as the reference for subsequent use.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Show orbit...</span> is only
present
if the selected object is a Binary system. It brings up a window
showing
the
orbit of the secondary around the primary and an ephemeris for one
revolution. See <a href="#SkyView_binary">Binary Star Map</a> for more

  </li>
</ul>
<ul>

supported. See <a href="#Trails">Trails.</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>

<h2><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId217563"></a> 5.3 Scale controls</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">FOV<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The vertical scale on the left side
sets the vertical field of view of the display. The horizontal field
of view is determined by the width of the window at the same scale.
The FOV can be varied in 5 minute increments from 0:05 through 180
degrees. The buttons below offer a quick way to set the scale to
exactly
90 degrees and to resize the window (by changing the width) to 1:1
and 2:1 Width:Height aspect ratios. When an image is loaded, an
additional button appears labeled Image. Clicking this will resize the
window to match the aspect ratio of the image. The FOV scale may also
be changed
using the keypad + and - keys. Using the key alone moves by 2%, with
Shift moves 10%. </div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alt / Dec</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The vertical scale on the right side
sets either the center altitude or declination, depending on the
display mode. The value can be varied from -90 to +90 in increments
of 5 minutes. The buttons below presents a quick way to center the
scale at exactly 45, 0 or -45 degrees. The Alt/Dec scale may also be
changed using the keypad Up and Down arrow keys (make sure your NumLock
is off). Using the key alone moves by 2%, with Shift moves 10%. </div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Az / RA</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The horizontal scale across the bottom
sets either the center azimuth or RA, depending on the display mode.
In Alt-Az mode this sets azimuth and can be varied from 0 to 359:55
degrees in steps of 5 minutes. In RA-Dec mode this sets Right
Ascension and can be varied from 0 to 23:59:40 hours, in steps of 20
seconds. The Az/RA scale may also be changed using the keypad Left and
Right arrow keys (make sure your NumLock is off). Using the key alone
moves by 2%, with Shift moves 10%. </div>
<a name="SkyView_trails"></a>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId444921"></a> 5.4 Trails</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p>The location of any object on the Sky view may be computed at
regular intervals and displayed by setting up a sky trail. Use the <a
 href="#Trails">Trails Setup</a> window to select the interval,
number of steps, formatting details and which steps you would like
annotated. The trail setup window is accessed from the popup which
appears when the third mouse button is activated when the cursor is
near an object. Any number of objects may have trails.</p>
<p>The trail is created by computing the location of the object at
several intervals. Each new location will be drawn with a small mark
and connected with a line to its previous location. The trails
remain correct if the display coordinate system is changed. Trails
may be turned on or off without loss of trail information. Trail
information is discarded if a trail is turned off when a new Main
window Update is performed. If any point on a trail is selected
using the third mouse button the information displayed is as per the
object at that time. The times displayed next to trailed objects are in
accord with the setting of <a href="#MainMenu_preferences">Preferences</a> ->
Time zone.
Trail information is <em>not</em> subject to the
constraints in the <a href="#SkyView_filter">Filter</a> window, <i>i.e.</i>,
trailed objects are always shown.</p>
<p>Note that in Alt-Az mode, each trailed location is positioned on
the display according to the sky at the current moment. But because
of diurnal motion these trails are not useful for comparison with
the background of fixed stars. Use the RA-Dec mode for that. This is
so important (and easily overlooked) that you will see a reminder
notice to this effect the first (and only) time you create and
display a trail in Alt-Az mode.</p>
<p>Finally, be sure to recompute any trails if you change any of
the preferences or circumstances in the Main window.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tracking<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Tracking in this context refers to
whether the pointing direction of the Sky View will automatically be
changed each time an Update occurs from the Main window such that
the tracked object will remain centered on the display. The object to
be
tracked is selected by using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Track</span>
option in its popup menu, as described elsewhere. When this toggle
button is sensitive and pushed-in it means that tracking is active for
one object. The tracked object will be marked with an &times; on the
display after each Update. If this toggle button is selected while it
is
sensitive, it turns tracking off. This is a convenient alternate method
to turn off object tracking without having to find the exact object
being tracked and use its popup Track control. When this toggle
button is insensitive and popped-out, it means that object tracking
is not active; it does nothing when selected while insensitive. </div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Just dots </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> This toggle effects how stars are
shown. When the toggle is pushed in, all stars are displayed simply
as dots of various sizes. When the toggle is released, each type of
star is displayed with a unique schematic symbol. These symbols may
be reviewed from the <a href="#SkyView_filter">Filter</a> window. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Flip Left/Right </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Flip Top/Bottom </div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Ecliptic plane </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> This toggles whether a red 2:2 dotted
line is shown along the ecliptic. The ecliptic is the plane of the
Earth's orbit or, as seen from Earth, the path of the Sun and the
approximate path of the planets across the sky. The anti-solar point
is marked with a small open circle. The Vernal and Autumnal equinoxes
and Summer and Winter solstice locations are marked and labeled as VEq,
AEq, SS and WS respectively. The North and South eclipic poles are
marked and labeled as
NEP and SEP, respectively.<br>
<br>
The
edges of umbra/penumbra of
Earth are marked with open circles. If <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Preferences &raquo; Equatorial</span>
is set to Topocentric, the umbra/penumbra are projected at the current
distance of the Moon and corrected for parallax; if set to
Geocentric they are projected at infinity. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Galactic plane </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> This toggles whether a red 1:4 dotted
line is shown along the galactic equator. The North and South galactic
poles are marked and labeled as NGP and SGP, respecively. The galactic

Milky Way boundary is also shown.</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Eyepieces </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> This toggles whether eyepieces are
drawn on the Sky view, if and when any are placed. <a
 href="#SkyView_eyepieces">Eyepieces</a> are placed on the Sky view by
using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Place eyepiece</span>
control in the popup menu activated by the right mouse button. The
shape and style of eyepieces is defined in the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Control &raquo; Eyepieces</span>
window. Eyepieces are only drawn if they fit entirely within the Sky
View. This selection is automatically activated when an eyepiece is
placed. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Magnitude key </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> This toggles whether to display a
chart
in the lower left corner showing the correspondence between dot size
and star magnitude. The scale is automatically turned off each time
an image is first displayed. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Compass rose </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> This toggles whether two symbols to
indicate the cardinal directions at the center of the Sky View in
each Display mode are drawn in the lower right corner. The symbol on
the right always shows the current mode, the symbol to its left the
opposite mode. The one labeled with <b>Z</b> and <b>R</b> indicates
the
local horizontal directions toward the Zenith and toward the Right; the
one labeled with <b>N</b> and <b>W</b> indicates equatorial North and
West. The symbols are not drawn near their respective poles. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Auto magnitude </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> When this toggle is active, the
faintest magnitudes and dot step size will automatically be set to
something reasonable based on the field of view. This option is
automatically turned on whenever the FOV changes for any reason,
unless it was turned off manually. Note that initial resource values
for faintest magnitudes and dot step size will not be honored unless
the
initial resource value for automag is also off.</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Field Stars </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> This toggles whether <a

displayed if the position, field of view, limiting magnitude or time
changes significantly. This selection turns itself off if any
difficulties ever arise in retrieving field stars. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Live dragging </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> This toggles whether the graphics are
redrawn in real time as the various scale controls are being slid,
or whether the graphics are not redrawn until the mouse is released.
What works best for you depends on the speed of the computer, display
and data bandwidth. If the system is fast enough, turning this on can
produce dramatic results. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Horizon map </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> This toggles whether to display the
local horizon profile on the Sky View and
whether objects below the horizon are drawn. The profile
linearly interpolates between points in the defining file. See <a
 href="#Horizon">Horizon</a>. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Clipping </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> This toggles whether objects

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> File name<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">This drop-down selection allows you to
select the file that defines constellation figures. The files supplied
with XEphem are HAReyfigs.csf and classicfigs.csf to define the figures
defined by H. A. Rey or the classic definitions, respectively. The
files shown for possible selection are those files ending with the .csf
suffix in the Shared and Private directories.<br>
<br>
The definition file must contain exactly one figure for each of the 89
constellations. Leading white space, blank lines and lines beginning
with # are ignored. Each figure definition begins with a line
containing just its name followed by one or more lines of the form:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drawcode ra dec [comment]<br>
where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drawcode is a numeric value indicating a drawing
instruction as follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 move to ra dec<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 draw solid line to ra dec<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 draw dashed line to ra dec<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ra is decimal hours or sexigesimal h:m:s<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dec is decimal degrees or sexigesimal d:m:s<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the remainder of the line is ignored and may be any

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId353932"></a> 5.5.1.5 Labeling:</h4>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This portion controls labeling
options.
The sliders select how many of the brightest objects to label in
each of four categories. The count ranges from 0 on the left to All
on the right.<br>
<br>
The label itself may consist of the Name or Magnitude or both,
depending on the state of the two buttons in the columns marked N
and M to the left of each scale. If Names and Magnitudes are both
turned on then the magnitude is drawn to the right of the name
surrounded by parentheses. Magnitudes are always drawn to the
nearest 1/10 with the decimal point removed.<br>

objects
supported by XEphem. Using the Filter window, you may select which
classes of objects are displayed on the Sky view window. For
reference, the Filter window also contains the schematic symbol for
each type of object, and its code when used in a database file. The
symbol displayed for each class of object is that which will be used to
represent the object in the Sky view, unless <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Control &raquo; Options &raquo; Just</span>

that the symbol used to draw an Elliptical object in the Sky View is
the same as that for objects of type Hyperbolic and Parabolic if the
name of the object begins with "C/" (presumed to denote a comet).<br>
<br>
Three scales near the bottom of the Filter window control the faintest
magnitude limit to be displayed for Stars, Solar system and Deep sky
objects. Note that trails and persistent labels are not subject to the
faint magnitude limits.<br>
<br>
The diameter of the symbol drawn in the Sky View is the larger of the
object's actual size at the current window scale (if a size is
specified in the database entry for the object) or a size that is
proportional to the difference between the object's magnitude and the
current faintest magnitude setting.<br>
<br>
The fourth scale in the lower left selects the number of magnitudes
binned in each dot size. Values larger than 1 are helpful for showing
very large ranges of magnitudes.<br>

Several push buttons appear across the bottom of the Filter window
which have the usual effects: Selecting <span

This window lists, sorts and writes the objects currently displayed
in the Sky View to a file. Basing the list on the Sky View allows the
selection criteria to use the full power of the Options and Filters
controls as well as the region of the sky as defined by the center and
field of view. If you wish to include all objects without regard to
position, use the Cylindrical project mode, set RA-Dec, FOV 180, Dec 0
and resize the Sky View window to show the entire universe.<br>
<br>
At the top, the format of the file created may be specified in either
of two formats. The .edb format saves the objects in the XEphem
catalog format. This is handy for using the XEphem filtering options
to create custom catalogs. The text format is a columnar listing. The
columns that are printed are the same as those currently selected in
the Data Table, printed to the precision specified in the <a
 href="#MainMenu_preferences">Preferences</a>. A convenient button is
provided to bring up the Date Table setup window. Note that a column
need not be printed to be used for sorting, although it would seem
unusual to do so.<br>
<br>
The center section lists several fields that may used for sorting the
list. Pick each field in the order you wish to sort the list. If you
wish to make a change to the order, you may Undo one at a time back to
the beginning or Clear the entire sequence and begin again.<br>
<br>
The bottom section is a text field which (will) show the results of
the sort. This text field is fully editable, so you may delete specific
objects, add comments and so on as desired. N.B. If you have chosen
the .edb format, no checks are made that your edits have made the
format illegal.<br>
<br>
Pressing the right mouse button over the text field will bring up a

at all azimuths. To use this method, type the desired altitude in the
field provided, then type Enter or toggle the button labeled <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Constant</span> On.<br>
<br>
The other way is to draw your actual horizon profile interactively as
follows:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Set the Sky View to display Alt-Az mode;</li>
  <li>set Az to 0, Alt to 90, FOV to 180 so you see your entire sky;</li>
  <li>click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit with mouse</span>;</li>
  <li>draw your horizon with the mouse;</li>
  <li>when finished turn Edit with mouse back off;<br>
  </li>
  <li>enter a file name;</li>
  <li>click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span>.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Editing can in fact be performed in any mode but the above setup is the
most natural. Reload the profile later using <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Load</span>.
As many profiles can be stored as desired. For example, if you
observe from several sites, you can have a profile for each.<br>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">File format</span><br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The Horizon profile file
format (suffix <tt>.hzn</tt>) and its use by
XEphem are defined as follows:<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Each line should contain exactly two numbers separated by
spaces.</li>
    <li>The first number is the azimuth, expressed as degrees East of
North.</li>
    <li>Azimuth values range from 0 up to 360 degrees. Any values
outside
this range have 360 added or subtracted until they fall in this
range.</li>
    <li>The lines need not be sorted by Azimuth, although they will be
sorted when used; thus the horizon map can never cross itself.</li>
    <li>If the file does not include the full range of Azimuths, the
end points will be connected automatically.</li>
    <li>It is ok to specify just one point (at any Azimuth). This will
result in a flat horizon all the way around at the specified
Altitude. This is functionally equivalent to using the Constant
method.</li>
    <li>The second number is degrees above horizontal.</li>
    <li>XEphem linearly interpolates as necessary when drawing between
the Az and Alt values in the file.</li>
    <li>Lines of any other form are ignored.</li>
  </ul>

<img alt="" src="png/sky-control-eyepieces.png" align="right"
 height="564" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="326">This
window allows you to specify the shape, rotation angle, size and style
of the next eyepiece marker to be placed in the Sky View. These
markers are useful to show the view through your eyepiece, simulate
the view of a CCD camera, or as simple annotation markers for any
desired purpose. Symbology on the map will show through the eyepieces,
even when they are specified as solid.
<br>
<br>
Note that this window controls the style of the next eyepiece to be
created. To actually place an eyepiece, place the mouse over the Sky
view where you want the center to be located and press the right
button. A popup menu will appear. Slide down the menu and release over <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Place eyepiece</span>. When an eyepieces is
place on the sky, both the RA-Dec and Alt-Az of the location are saved
and the set
matching the Display mode is used when the eyepiece is drawn on the
Sky View. In this way eyepieces are fixed in both coordinate systems.<br>
<br>
<b>Set next eyepiece ...</b><br>
<blockquote>Across the top are three sliders which set the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">W</span>idth, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">H</span>eight and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>ngle of the next eyepiece. Width
and Height are shown in units of degrees:minutes.
The interpretation of the rotation angle depends on the
current display mode of the Sky View at the moment a new eyepiece is
placed. When in Alt/Az mode, the angle is away from a line through the
Zenith, and when in RA/Dec mode the angle is away from the North
Celestial Pole. In both cases, the units are degrees.
<br>
  <br>
Below them is a toggle that will <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lock</span>
the W and H sliders so they move together. This makes it easy to
create eyepiece shapes that are perfectly round or square.<br>
  <br>
As a special convenience for and in deference to, there is a toggle
which will create three open circles spaced to match the view through
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Telrad</span> unit power finder.
The circles are 0.5, 2 and 4 degrees in diameter. As long as this
special toggle is pushed in, the other controls are made insensitive
to avoid interfering with the preset values for the Telrad.<br>
  <br>
Next below are pairs of toggle buttons to select the Shape and Style
of the next eyepiece. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Elliptical</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rectangular</span> refer to
circles
and squares. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Solid</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Outline</span> refer to whether the shape
will be filled in or just drawn as a border.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Field-of-View Calculators</b><br>
<blockquote>In the central portion of the Eyepiece window are two <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">calculators</span> that can be used to
compute the sky angle of an optical system in two ways. The first
method uses the net focal length of the entire optical system and a
linear size on the focal plane. The technique is handy for CCD users
who want to find the sky angle subtended by each pixel or the entire
detector. Another good use of this form is for photographers using
film to find the amount of sky that will fit on their film. To cover
this wide range of applications, the measures may be specified in any
of several common units by adding the appropriate suffix. Default
units are shown in parentheses.<br>
  <br>
The second calculator uses the apparent field of view while looking
into an eyepiece and divides this by the magnification, which in turn
is found from the ratio of focal lengths for the primary mirror and
the eyepiece. Typical eyepieces provide about 45 degrees apparent
fields of view, and some premium ones can go to 60 degrees or more.
After using either method, the resulting sky angle can be assigned to
the Width or Height scale for the next eyepiece by using the Set W and
H buttons to the right.<br>

<b>Saving Eyepiece Definitions</b><br>
<blockquote>This portion of the Eyepieces window allows you to <b>Add</b>
the current eyepiece settings to a list of favorites. A simple

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This window provides a means to add
World Coordinate System headers to a FITS file. With WCS, XEphem
(and many other programs) can compute the RA and Dec of each pixel
in the file, not just its X and Y pixel coordinates. This capability
opens the door to many interesting possibilities. The algorithm
performs
a pattern match between the star-like artifacts in the image and the
GSC

window allows you to display a FITS file in the Sky View window. You
may display local files or download the Digital Sky Survey directly
from the Internet. The image is resized to match the size of the Sky

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This button heads up the section for
downloading Digital Sky Survey images from the Internet You may
choose generations 1 and 2, and either Red or Blue filters for the
latter. The DSS is maintained by the Space Telescope Science
Institute, STScI, in the United States or the European Southern
Observatory, ESO, research facility in Germany. The image data from
either site is identical, so choosing which to use depends only on
availability and whichever is faster for you.<br>
<br>
The size and position of the image are that of the current Sky View
settings, but the size is limited to 30 arc minutes by agreement
with each institution. Before attempting a download, use the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">File &raquo; Network setup</span>

<br>
Clicking Display will begin the download. A progress meter will display

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">FITS Header:</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This section consists mainly of a
scrolled text area which shows each field in the FITS header.<br>
<br>
If the
header contains any of the fields EPOCH, JD or DATE-OBS then the
date of the observation is displayed above the header. The button
labeled <span style="font-weight: bold;">Set time</span> will also
come
alive which allows setting the main XEphem time and date to this
value. This is handy when checking for asteroids, comets or using
the proper motion catalogs with an image. EPOCH must be a decimal year;
JD must be a decimal Julian Date; or DATE-OBS must be either in ISO
8601
format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS),&nbsp; YYYY[/-]MM[/-]DD, or MM[/-]DD[/-]YY
where YY is assumed to be the number of years since 2000 if less than
50 otherwise years since 1900.<br>
<br>
In order to be displayed by XEphem, the header in a FITS file must
contain at least the mandatory fields SIMPLE, BITPIX, NAXIS, NAXIS1,
NAXIS2 and END. Only files with BITPIX 8 or 16 and NAXIS 2 are
supported. Both DSS PLATE headers and the traditional World
Coordinate System fields (CTYPE, CROTA, CRPIX, CDELT and CRVAL, 1 and
2) are supported. BSCALE and BZERO are not supported at this time.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Note:</span> XEphem treats the 16
bit pixels as unsigned values from 0 through 65535, unlike the
standard which specifies they be treated as signed with values from
-32768 through 32767. XEphem assigns the coordinate [0,0] to be the
center of the first pixel in the file, unlike the standard which
specifies this position be at coordinate [1,1].<br>
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Save as:</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The image currently displayed, if any,
may be saved to disk as a FITS file. The file name is specified in
the text field provided. If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto
name</span> is turned on, a filename is automatically created derived
from the RA and Dec of the center of the image. An attempt is made to
preserve any existing directory and filename extensions, such that
the filename is constructed between the right-most '/' and the
right-most '.' characters, if possible. You may also type in your
own name.<br>
<br>
When an image is saved, its current contrast settings are added to
the FITS headers. If these fields are present when the file is
opened these settings will automatically be put back into effect.
See <a href="#SkyIP_Contrast">Contrast</a>.<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">File
watch:</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This feature allows XEphem to
automatically discover and display FITS files that were created by
another program. When <span style="font-weight: bold;">Watch</span> is
turned on, XEphem will try to open the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">watch</span>
file named in the text field provided here approximately once each
second and display the file named on the first line of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">watch</span> file. If successful XEphem
removes the <span style="font-style: italic;">watch</span> file as a
means to handshake the image has been displayed.<br>
<br>
With this feature and the popularity of various networked file systems
(NFS, Samba, etc) it is quite reasonable to display images with
XEphem that were captured on an entirely different computer, or on
the same computer running camera control software unrelated to
XEphem.<br>
<br>
A further note to implementors: XEphem also supports the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">watch</span> file being a fifo. In this
case, XEphem will open the fifo and block trying to read a path name up
to the first newline. There is no handshake in this case. The fifo
approach is actually a bit more efficient than the file approach
because no polling is required. </div>

<h3><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId883609"></a> 5.6.2 Image Analysis Tools</h3>
The Sky Image Tools window offers several functions with which to
analyze the FITS file showing in the Sky View. There are a few sample
FITS files included with which to practice using the tools.<br>
<br>
The window is divided into several separate sections, each of which
can be opened and closed as desired. Always present at the top of the
window is a block of basic information about the image. The statistics
ignore a border of 8 pixels. The information shown is: file name;
width and height; value and location of brightest pixel; value of
dimmest pixel; mean, median and standard deviation of all pixels.<br>
<br>
Note two <span style="font-style: italic;">important differences</span>
between XEphem and FITS: 1) XEphem treats the 16 bit image pixels as
unsigned values from 0 through 65535, unlike the FITS standard which
specifies they be treated as signed with values from -32768 through
32767. 2) XEphem image coordinates are one less than the FITS
standard. FITS defines the center of the first pixel in the file to be
at [1,1] while XEphem defines it to be at [0,0]. <a

Narrow assigns full black and white to the mean &plusmn; 1/3 Std Dev.
Wide assigns black to mean - 1*StdDev and white to mean + 2*StdDev.
Full

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Gammas</span><br>
<br>

function. Values of gamma less than 1 emphasize dark pixels, gamma
values greater than 1 emphasize bright pixels. </div>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">graph</span> contains two
overlaid
plots. The horizontal axis for each plot is the same: the full range
of pixel values within the image, with lowest on the left. The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">orange line</span> is a histogram of the
number of pixels with each value. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">yellow
line</span> indicates the brightness at which each pixel value will be
displayed on the screen. You may control the black and white limits of
the mapping function from the graph by dragging the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">red arrows</span> at the top of the
diagram.
You may control gamma by sliding the scale ust above the graph.<br>
<br>
When XEphem saves an image, it adds three fields to the FITS header
to save the current contrast settings. When it loads an image, if
these fields are present they are used to restore the same display
contrast. If these fields are not present, the Wide setting is used.
These fields are: XELOGLUT: the pixel value assigned to black
XEHIGLUT: the pixel value assigned to white XEGAMMA: the value of
Gamma. <a name="SkyIP_Slice"></a>

Click and hold the left mouse button as you roam over the image and
you will see an expanded view of the pixels. The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Size</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Mag</span>nifying power of the glass can be
set as desired using the two rows of toggle buttons. Note the numbers
on these buttons are in units of screen pixels, not image pixels. So
for example if you zoom in on an area the magnifying glass will expand
it correspondingly further.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 32px; height: 29px;" alt="" title=""
 src="png/sky-images-ia-snap-tb.png" align="left">While roaming you
might want to turn on the Jump to Max button on the right hand toolbar.
It is the one with the bright dot in the center to which a meandering
arrow finally points. When this button is on, XEphem will begin at the
pixel under the real cursor and walk the gradient to the brightest
connected pixel. All processing proceeds as though this brightest
pixel is where the cursor really pointed.<br>
<br>
Statistics about the image pixels under the glass are shown in the
table. All values are in pixels, all locations are in image
coordinates.
Fractional image coordinates occur because the image is resized to fit
the window which results in rational values for the scale factors. If
you zoom in enough to clearly see individual image pixels, you can see
that the coordinate system for image pixels puts the integral position
in the center.<br>
<br>
The statistics in the table include:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<ul>
  <li>Size of the area under the glass;</li>
  <li>Value and location of the center;</li>
  <li>Value and location of the largest pixel under the glass;</li>

  <li>Mean value of all glass pixels;</li>
  <li>Median value of all glass pixels;</li>
  <li>One Standard Deviation of the pixel values about the mean.</li>
</ul>

Measurements</h4>
<img style="width: 240px; height: 283px;" alt="" title=""
 src="png/sky-images-ia-gauss.png" align="right" hspace="20">This
section is based on results of modeling stars with a 2 dimensional
Gaussian.<br>
<br>
The model finds the coefficients in the following function of pixel
coordinates x and y that minimizes the Chi square error with each
pixel in an area:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family: monospace;">g(x,y)
= B + A*exp(-0.5*(sqr((x-mx)/sx) + sqr((y-my)/sy)))</span> </div>
<br>
where<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> mx is the row coordinate from some
reference position,<br>
my is the same for a column,<br>
sx is the standard deviation of the pixel values along a row,<br>
sy is the same for a column,<br>
A is the peak height of function ( = g(xm,ym) - g(inf,inf)),<br>
B is the mean of the row and column pixels. </div>
<br>
[mx,my] is then taken to be the location of the star, the volume as
proportional to A*sx*sy as a measure of its magnitude, and B a measure
of the mean noise level of the surrounding pixels.<br>
<br>
In practice, we find this method converges quickly and yields
positional results accurate to .2 pixel or so. Magnitudes and their
error estimates depend strongly on whether the image was ever
compressed, proper image correction, linearity of ADU counts with
brightness, and other factors. When these factors are properly
addressed, magnitude ratios seem to be good to .02 mag or so over
differences of several magnitudes.<br>
<br>
The text box shows the results of this fitting process on the image
pixels that are centered on the cursor and lie within the area defined
by the magnifying glass settings (whether or not the glass is actually
turned on). The numbers report the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Relative magnitude difference and error estimate between the
current star and the reference star;</li>
  <li>Position of the star, in image coordinates and in RA/Dec if WCS
header fields are present;</li>
  <li>Full-width-half-max of the star in each dimension in pixels,
and in arc seconds if the image scale is known from header fields
CDELT1 and CDELT2;</li>
  <li>The pixel value representative of the noise level base in the
area (B in the above equation);</li>
  <li>The pixel value of the peak of the Gaussian fit (A+B in the
equation).</li>
</ul>
If there is a number in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reference
Mag</span> text field, it is simply added to the magnitude reported.
The idea is to set this to the magnitude of a star (known by
independent means) and use that star as the reference for subsequent
comparison. Since the reference is now calibrated, magnitudes reported
will be absolute not just relative. Except under special situations,
the reference star will not be applicable to other images, although
XEphem does not prevent you from doing this.<br>
<br>
The reference star can be established in several ways.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> One way is automatic in the sense that
if there is no current reference, the first star that is measured is
also automatically given the role as reference for subsequent
comparisons. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> After any star has been measured, it
can be made the reference by clicking on <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">New.</span> Clicking <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Mark</span> will draw a small circle in
the image around the current reference star in case you lose track
of it. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Another way to set the reference is to
use a catalog star. This is only possible, of course, if the header
includes WCS coordinates. Right-click on the catalog star in the Sky
View and choose the entry <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Photom
ref</span>. This will perform the Gaussian fit on the pixels at
that stars location in the image, and assign the Reference Magnitude
to the catalog value. </div>

 vspace="5" width="300">Registration<br>
</h3>
This window lets you register, or align, one or more images to a
reference image. The motivation for this feature is to make a
movie of a moving object that has been captured in several images.
Load the reference image into a new <a href="#Movie">Movie</a> then
load each additional image after it is aligned.<br>
<br>
The alignment algorithm requires two stars that appear in each image.
Using two stars is the most general method of defining a 2D coordinate
system and is used for its robust performance. It is possible to use
just one star, but the technique requires the software to make
assumptions about matching features in the image. We feel the slightly
larger burden of defining two stars is worth the results. When choosing
the two reference stars, select stars that are well separated in both
rows
and columns, isolated from neighboring stars, moderately bright and
well
formed.<br>
<br>
To begin, load the reference image into Sky View and adjust the
contrast or other visual effects as desired. Then click the first
toggle in the window. The cursor will change over the Sky View to a
small cross. Place the cursor over one reference star and click; you
will see the Gaussian centroid image coordinates of the star
appear in the registration window for Star 1. Now choose a second
reference star and click again. You will see its coordinates appear for
Star 2, the cursor will revert back to the original style and the
toggle button will pop back out. If you ever want to change the
reference image choose different reference stars, you can turn on the
top
toggle again at any time and restart the procedure. This is a good time
to
delete any frames currently in the Movie tool and add the reference
image to form the first frame of a movie.
<br>
<br>
Now you can load a second image. Again, adjust contrast and so on as
desired. Click on the second toggle in the registration window and
proceed as before to click on <i>the same two stars</i> in the second
image. Be sure to click on the two stars in the same order, so that the
first star clicked when defining the reference stars is also the first
star clicked when working on the second image.<br>
<br>
As soon as the second star is clicked on the second image, the image
will be transformed using translation, scaling and rotation in such a
way as to align the two stars with their location in the reference
image. The contrast settings are preserved for you even though the
image
pixel statistics have changed due to the addition of new black pixels
where
the images do not overlap and the loss of pixels that do not fit over
the
reference image. If the results look useful, add it to the Movie.<br>
<br>
You may repeat the process of aligning additional images with the
reference image for as many images you like.<br>
<br>
Note that while either toggle is turned on in the registration window,
the other image analysis tools are temporarily disabled. Note also that
the algorithm used to transform the image to match the reference image
is
designed primarily for speed. The stars in the transformed image are a
little
distorted and we recommend you not use these images for precise
photometry or
astrometry.<br>

algorithm that attempts to
register the star-like artifacts in a FITS image with the entries in
any or all of the XEphem Field Star catalogs. See <a
 href="#Field_Stars_">Field stars</a>.<br>
<b><br>
</b>The solver will be invoked automatically whenever a FITS file is
loaded whose header includes all the seed fields but does not already
have a WCS solution.<br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt><br>
</tt>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rows
1-5: setting seed values</span> </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> The first five rows seed the search
with approximate coordinates for the center of the image, the scale
of the image pixels in each direction, and a possible rotation. The
center must be known to within about one half the smaller of the image
width and height. The scale must be known to within about 10%. The
rotation seed need not be accurate at all, but better estimates will
result in vastly faster solution times. Indeed, better values for any
field will improve the solution speed and also reduce the chances of a
false solution. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> Each of the fields may be typed or
pasted into the fields down the left. But often FITS files will
include fields which contain information suitable for this purpose.
In the column down the right you may enter the names of such fields.
Clicking the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Use field</span> button
in
a row will read the value from the header field named on the right and
install it into the field on the left of the same row, possibly after
some reformatting and change of units. Certainly not all forms are
supported so please take care to check for proper units and
formatting yourself. The default fields supplied are fairly common
and are known to work if you are lucky enough to have them in your
images. </div>

6: scanning the image for star-like artifacts</span> </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> The next row contains two parameters
which control the algorithm that scans an image to extract what seem
to be reasonable candidates for stars, that presumably will also be
in a Field star catalog. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Burned
out</span>: This parameter sets the largest pixel value (in the
range 0 .. 65535) a star may contain. Groups of pixels being
considered as a candidate star by the algorithm will immediately
reject the entire group if even one pixel is higher than this. The
idea here is that if a star is so bright as to be even a little burned
out, its centroided position is likely to be worse than not using it
at all. If you feel otherwise, set this to 65535 and no groups will
be rejected (at least for this reason). </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">S/N
ratio</span>: This parameter sets the minimum signal-to-noise ratio
of a candidate star. The algorithm breaks an image into several
smaller regions and computes several statistics of all the pixels in
that region. In order for a group of pixels to be considered a star,
its
brightest pixel must be at least the median plus this parameter
multiplied by the standard deviation computed from the statistics of
the region in which it is located. Basically, the larger this
number, the more distinct the star must be. </div>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> The bottom row contains two parameters
that effect the goal of the search algorithm.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Max pix acc</span>: This parameter
tells the search algorithm not to expect position information for
the star-like artifacts extracted from an image to be any better
than this fraction of a pixel.<br>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>WCS Solver Tutorial<br>
</b><br>
<blockquote>The first step is to supply suitable seeds values for the
center of the image, the image scale and any suspected rotation. If the
FITS image header contains fields with these values, enter the names of
the fields in the spaces provided and they will be extracted
automatically when the image is loaded. If the header does not contain
this information, or the units are not correct, then seed values must
be entered manually in the fields provided. Note that the pixel scale
values must have the correct sign since the algorithm automatically
takes into account rotation but not flipping.<br>
  <br>
The second step is to set the SNR value so that Marking stars finds
most of the brightest and well-formed star-like objects in the image,
without also finding bogus star candidates. Also, if the image was over
exposed so that very bright stars are washed out, eliminate these by
reducing the value for burned out stars.<br>
  <br>
Once good stars are being marked, the last step is to indicate how
accurately star centroids can be determined and how accurate any
solution is likely to be using the bottom two fields of the form.<br>
  <br>
Another issue is to use an appropriate field star catalog. More
stars&nbsp; is not&nbsp; necessarily better. For example, the GSC 2.2
goes to mag 18 but also tends to have more bogus entries near very
bright stars. If your image contains a very bright star, take note of
the field stars that are near it; you might do better with the GSC 1.2
than 2.2 catalogs.<br>
  <br>
After adjusting any field, click Go. If a solution is found, the stars
used in the fit will be marked and statistics about the fit will be
displayed.<br>
  <br>
This algorithm has proven to be very robust over the years. With a
little practice it can usually be made to work quite well.<br>

<h2><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId365647"></a> 5.8 Sky View Telescope
menu</h2>
The Telescope menu in Sky View
allows you to connect to and control a telescope and, if using the INDI
protocol, any other instrumentation whatsoever. The control can be
performed via a simple fifo connection, or a much more flexible INDI
interface. For a complete description of the INDI protocol, please
download the reference specification from <a
 href="https://www.clearskyinstitute.com/INDI/INDI.pdf">https://www.clearskyinstitute.com/INDI/INDI.pdf</a>.
Here we only describe the INDI configuration window, the INDI
control panel, testing the INDI system using the sample drivers, and
finally the&nbsp; simple fifo interface.<br>
<br>
Regardless of which means is used to send a new position to a
telescope, the menu contains a history list of targets. Clicking on one
of these will send that target again. A button is available to erase
the list at any time.<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId87479"></a> 5.8.1 INDI Test Drivers</h3>
Beneath the source directory of XEphem is a directory <tt>tools/indi</tt>.
This contains several sample INDI drivers that together simulate an
entire observatory. Please read the README and follow the instructions
to build and run the sample drivers. This will allow you to perform a
live test of XEphem's INDI windows to be described next.<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId620571"></a> 5.8.2 INDI Configuration
window</h3>
<img alt="" src="png/indiconfig.png" align="right" height="318"
 width="674">The top row of this window contains two text fields by
which you to
specify the TCP/IP host and port name to which a connection is to be
made to an INDI driver or server. The default values are suitable for
running the test drivers mentioned above.<br>
<br>
The remaining rows define the mapping between internal XEphem
functionality and the external INDI devices. All information flows over
the INDI protocol based on Properties. Each property is defined as a
Device, a Property and an array of one or more Elements. The INDI
protocol does not
prescribe the names or the meanings of Properties, it is up to the
client and servers to agree. Recommended practice will evolve as
community participation matures. The sample drivers supplied with
XEphem make some possible choices for properties and names.<br>
<br>
The default settings in the Configuration window are the correct
mappings for these sample drivers. The idea is to specify the
Device.Property.Element that corresponds to each purpose. The
Configuration window also allows entering a multiplier and offset that
is applied to the INDI value to compute the value in units used within
XEphem. For example, the units for Mount.EQUATORIAL_COORD.RA are hours
but XEphem
wants this value in radians, hence the multiplier set to 0.2617993.
When connecting to drivers for which the
name mapping is not yet known, one technique for discovering their
Properties is to watch the INDI Control Panel (described next) for each
new Property that is reported when connecting toan INDI server. <br>
<br>
One of the options is whether to display a <b>marker</b> at the
telescope position on the Sky View. Below this ia a toggle button to
specify whether the Sky
View will automatically <b>Recenter</b> in order to keep the telescope
Marker in the
field of view. The option applies both to INDI and fifo marker
commands. When Recenter is On, then the telescope Marker is
automatically turned off whenever the Sky View is manually adjusted
(the rationale being that one will most likely not want the Sky View to
bounce back to the telescope position after having been manually
changed).<br>
<br>
Another option is whether communication with the telescope driver uses
astrometric J2000 coordinates, the default, or apparent coordinates
at the current epoch. This choice is independent of the overall 
Equinox setting in the main XEphem window. <br>
<br>
Note that the sample drivers do not support all XEphem functionality.
For example, the sample drivers do not support being sent a new time
and date. This is included in XEphem in case it is useful someday for
some other driver and to illustrate how XEphem stores dates internally
as a modified Julian date, ie, with an offset of 2415020 removed.<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId249275"></a> 5.8.3 INDI Control Panel</h3>
<img alt="" src="png/indicontrol.png" align="right" height="432"
 width="561">This window shows the realtime operation of an INDI
server. It is
divided into a top and bottom section. The proportion of screen space
used by each half may be controlled using the sash control located
just about the bottom scrolled area.<br>
<br>
The top half is a scrolled text area that shows the status messages
arriving from each device. Each message is preceded with a time stamp,
followed by the Device followed by the message text. The <b>Erase</b>
button will permanently remove all messages from the scrolled text.
Clicking on the <b>Trace to</b> button will append the current set of
messages to the file named in the text field to the right and append
all further messages to this file until tracing is turned off.<br>
<br>
The bottom half shows each INDI Device, Property and Element to which
XEphem is connected. Each Device may be expanded or collapsed to
control screen space. The entire list can be scrolled up and down. The <b>Connect</b>
button controls whether XEphem will connect to the INDI device whose
host and port are defined in the INDI Configuration window. If a
connection is successful, each of the reported Properties will appear
in the bottom scrolled area.<br>
<br>
Under each Device is a list of its Properties. Each INDI Property may
be in one of four states: Idle, Ok, Busy and Alert. These are shown as
a light to the left of the Property colored gray, green, yellow and
red, respectively. To the left of each Device is also a light, colored
the same the highest activity color of any of its Properties. In this
way the status of the most active Property can be determined even when
a Device is collapsed in the window.<br>
<br>
INDI Properties can be one of four types. These are Numeric, Text,
Switches and Lights. The first three may be read-write or read-only. A
light is always considered read-only (set only by the Device, not by
the operator). Each Element of each Property is shown on one line. The
left side of the line is the label. Following the label is the current
value and, if read-write, followed by a text field for entering a new
value. Read-write Properties will have a push button to the left of
their name to set a new value; pressing Return in the text field will
also set a new value. Switches will show each switch with their label.
Switches may be defined to operate according to the rules one-of-many,
any-of-many and at-most-one.<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId572031"></a> 5.8.4 FIFO Control</h3>
Completely separate from the INDI interface, Sky View implements two
simple
fifos for communicating with a telescope control d&aelig;mon or other
processes or scripts. Each fifo must be in either the
<a href="file://help/xephem.html#SharedPrivateDirs">Private</a>
or
<a href="file://help/xephem.html#SharedPrivateDirs">Shared</a>
directory.
<ol>
  <li><b>Inbound:</b> A marker may be placed on the Sky View by
writing a text string to the fifo named <b>fifos/xephem_in_fifo</b>.
The format allows for sending either equatorial or horizon coordinates.
To send an equatorial coordinate, the format is "<tt>RA:X Dec:Y</tt>",
where X
and Y are in radians at epoch 2000.0. To send a horizon coordinate, the
format
is "<tt>Alt:X Az:Y</tt>", where X and Y are in radians. The Sky View
center pointing position will be changed if necessary to make the
marker
visible. XEphem attempts to open this fifo each time the Sky View
window is
opened and closes it when the view is closed. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Outbound:</b> If a process has the fifo named <b>fifos/xephem_loc_fifo</b>
open for reading when the Sky View popup menu is activated, then the
menu will
offer a button to send the cursor position to this fifo. The format is
the
same as a line in .edb format. If it is not already open XEphem
attempts to
open this fifo each time the popup is activated, and leaves it open
until
writing to it fails. Each position sent to the fifo is added to the
Telescope history list.<br>

 hspace="10" vspace="10" width="458">This window displays a map of a
binary
star system and a matching ephemeris. It is displayed from the popup
that appears when the mouse is right-clicked over a binary object in
the Sky View.<br>
<br>
The map is at left, oriented with equatorial N up and E left, as on the
unaided sky. Each star is drawn in a color according to its spectral
class. The primary star is drawn at the center. A scale at the bottom
shows the sky dimensions of the plot.<br>
<br>
If complete orbital elements are available, one orbit is plotted at
equal time intervals marked by small dots. The largest dot in the orbit
marks the position of the secondary nearest to the current XEphem time,
medium size dots mark other locations each ten steps.<br>
<br>
If only discrete positions for the secondary are known, the plot is
simply one dot for each.<br>
<br>
The table on the right lists the position of each plotted secondary
position. The columns are the dot number, year, separation in arc
seconds and
position
angle as degrees East of North. The separation and position angle at
the current XEphem time are available in the <i>More info</i> <a

the listing file named and titled, if desired, select the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Create list file</span> toggle button. Now
each time XEphem goes through one iteration the values you have

<h2><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId511473"></a> 6.3 Solve equation</h2>
<img alt="" src="png/solver.png" align="right" height="462" hspace="10"
 width="225">This
window controls the automatic equation solving facility. You define an
arithmetic or boolean function, using most of the fields XEphem
displays, then XEphem will automatically evaluate the function and
adjust the time on each iteration to solve for the goal. To set up a
function to solve, follow these steps: Enter a function, Compile it,
Select a goal, Set the desired accuracy, Enable solving, Start the
solving process. Each of these steps is described below.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Entering the function<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The function may be any arithmetic
expression, in C-language syntax. All of C's comparison, logical and
arithmetic operators are supported as well as several common
arithmetic functions. The complete list is: </div>
<br>
<div style="font-family: monospace; margin-left: 80px;"> + - * /
&amp;&amp; || &gt; &gt;= == != &lt; &lt;= abs floor sin cos tan asin
acos atan degrad raddeg pi log log10 exp sqrt pow atan2 </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <br>
The function is entered into the text line provided. It may utilize
most of the fields from the other XEphem windows. Press the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Enable field buttons</span> button to
make each available field a button. Where ever a field is desired in
the function, position the text insertion cursor at the desired
position and select the field; its name will be inserted into the
function text. When you are finished defining the function, turn off
the field button appearance by selecting the Enable button again. </div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Compiling the function<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Once the function has been created as
desired, it must be compiled by selecting the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Compile</span> button (or by pressing the
Enter key on your keyboard). If there are any errors, a diagnostic
message will appear just below the function. Once a function has
been successfully compiled, the message will read No compile errors.
If the function is modified, a message will remind you that it has
not been compiled. Each time a function is successfully compiled,
XEphem updates all fields and evaluates the function. As explained
below, this can be used as an astronomical calculator even when not
actually solving anything. </div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Selecting a goal<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> You may choose from any of four
evaluation algorithms, as selected by the trio of radio buttons. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Find Maximum </span>and <b>Find Minimum</b>
will solve for a maxima
or minima of the function, respectively. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Find 0</span>
will solve for a time when the function evaluates to zero. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Binary</span> will keep incrementing time
by <a href="#main_looping">Step</a> until the state of the function
changes, then do a binary search to find the exact time when the
function changes state. Binary search interprets a function that
evaluates to zero to be in one state and all other values to be the
opposite state. Generally, binary functions are comprised of logical
operators at their outermost expression levels. </div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Specifying the desired accuracy<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Searching will automatically stop when
the time changes by less than the desired accuracy value. Note that
this method of detecting convergence is not based on the value of
the search function itself. </div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Enabling the solver<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Once the function is defined and it
compiles without errors, you may enable searching for a solution by
selecting the button at the top labeled <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Solving is Active.</span> Then,
referring now to the <a href="#main_looping">looping</a> section of
the
Main window, each time an Update occurs the solution advances by one
time step until either N Steps iterations have occurred or until
Step becomes less than Accuracy. The initial time and step size are set
from the Main window, and are adjusted automatically as the solution
proceeds. Note that by setting N Steps to 1 and repeatedly selecting
Update you can effectively single-step the process. Solving will
automatically turn off when convergence is detected, the function is
edited or you may turn it off manually at any time by clicking
Solver is Active back off.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving
and restoring a solver configuration<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> To save the Function, Goal and
Accuracy
so it can be loaded later, specify a file name and click <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Save to</span>. It will be saved in the <a
 href="#SharedPrivateDirs">Private</a> directory. The extension for
solver configuration files must be <span style="font-weight: bold;">.svc</span>
and will be added automatically if left off.
A configuration file may be loaded by selecting it from the option
popup menu to the right of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Load file</span>.
The menu will list all files that reside in the Shared and Private
directories with extension .svc. Note that reloading a solver
configuration only recreates the solving conditions; to be useful, the
fields to which the reloaded Function refers must be made active
independently.<br>
<br>
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional notes on using the
equation solver:</span><br>
<br>
When selecting fields for <a href="#Plot">plotting</a> or <a
 href="#Listing">listing</a> a button appears labeled <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Use for plotting</span>. You may select
this button to use the evaluated function as an item in the plot or
listing feature. Note that the function may be used in plotting or
listing whether or not actual solving is turned on.<br>
<p>The windows which contain the fields used in the function being
solved need not be visible while solving is in progress. However, the
field must be active, for example their row and column must be
selected if they are in the Data table.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Close</span> button removes
the Solving window from the screen; it does not effect actual solver
operation in any way.</p>
<p>A successfully compiled function is evaluated each time XEphem
updates. Whenever the function is compiled it is also evaluated using
freshly updated values. In this way, the Solve window can actually be
used as an arbitrary astronomical calculator at any time, whether or
not solving is actually active.</p>
<p>Solving periodic functions can lead to solutions far from the
intended range. You will get best results if you can start the search
near the expected answer and with a modest step size that will reach
the the
nominal solution within a few steps. You can use the <a href="#Plot">plotting</a>
feature to
study
a function and get an idea of the solution, then use the solver
feature to zero in.<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The sky dome is broken into bands of
constant Dec with height equal to the given separation. The database
is scanned once and each object brighter than the given limit is
dealt into its band and the one adjacent in the direction of the
North pole. Each band is then sorted by RA. Each band is then
scanned for close pairs, with rapid cutoff detection due to the
sort. The final list is then sorted by separation, and displayed.<br>
<br>
Total time is strongly influenced by the number of pairs in the result.
So when using wide separations it helps to use relatively bright
limiting magnitudes.<br>

a few days and watch how the rise and set times of objects and the
amount and timing of night time are effected throughout the year.<br

<img alt="" title="" src="png/coordconv.png" align="right" height="187"
 hspace="20" width="403"> This window performs simple conversions
among several common astronomical coordinate systems. Simply edit (or
paste) any coordinate and the others will update immediately. All
fields are in units of Degrees except RA is in Hours. Fields may be
entered in either sexagesimal or decimal format. For example, either
10:30:00 or 10.5.<br>
<br>
Altitude and Azimuth are with respect to the time and location set in
the Main window. These will change to correspond to the RA and Dec
values if an Update is performed.<br>
<br>
The top row are astrometric RA and Dec precessed to the given equinox
year, or enter EOD for apparent coordinates at the current epoch.
Unlike the other fields, edits to the equinox field only take effect
on Enter.<br>
<br>
The next row are RA and Dec using whatever is set in the Main Window.<br>
<br>
The controls across the bottom perform as follows<br>
<br>
<blockquote> <b>Close</b><br>
  <blockquote> Closes this window </blockquote>
  <b>Sky Point</b><br>
  <blockquote> Centers the Sky View at the current coordinates. </blockquote>
  <b>Eyepiece</b><br>
  <blockquote> Places an eyepiece in the Sky View at the coordinates

logbook</h2>
<img alt="" src="png/obslog.png" align="right" height="739" hspace="10"
 width="293">This
tool lets you store observing circumstances and notes. It is typically
used when making observations at the
telescope.<br>
<br>
When this window is open, the popup you get when right-clicking on an
object in the Sky View will contain a selection <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Add to logbook</span>. Clicking on this
choice will automatically fill in the top section of fields in the
logbook pertaining to
observing
circumstances and object information. To these fields you may add your
own <span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes</span> in the scrolled text
area at
the bottom, and equipment or <span style="font-weight: bold;">User
defined fields</span> if desired.<br>
<br>
There are two interesting controls available across the bottom as
follows:<br>
<b><br>
</b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b> List</b></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> This brings up a scrolled list showing
all entries in the logbook whose fields match those selected in the <b>S</b>
column. The field may contain&nbsp;<a href="#glob">glob</a> patterns
for a textual match or be
preceded with &lt; or &gt; for a numerical range match. Only those
fields selected with the<b> L</b> column will be
shown, and they may be sorted by the field selected in the<b> K</b>
column.<br>
<br>
You may <b>Save</b> the resulting scrolled list to a text file using
the
file name field provided. Right-clicking on an entry in the scrolled
list will mark the location of that log entry in the Sky View based on
its RA2000 and Dec2000 field values.<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <b>Add</b></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> This will add the current record to
the
logbook file. In keeping with the convention that log books are written
in ink, there is no mechanism provided for editing or removing existing
entries. Of course, one may always edit the log file independently.<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">File format</span><br>
<br>
The Observers logbook is a text file in XML format. The format should
be pretty self-explanatory. The file name is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">xelogbook.xml</span> in the Private
directory. The entire logbook is
contained in one XML element tagged <span style="font-weight: bold;">xelogbook
</span>with a version attribute 1.1.
Each log entry is in an element tagged <span style="font-weight: bold;">logentry</span>.
Within each logentry is
one element named the same as the label in the window, sans spaces if
any. The date fields are stored in the user's preferred format.<br>

loop</h2>
<img alt="" src="png/movie.png" align="right" height="324" hspace="10"
 width="411">The Movie tool allows you to capture any
number of View, <a href="#NightAtAGlance">Night at a Glance</a> or <a
 href="#Plot">Plot</a> windows and collect them into a movie. The
frames of the movie can be viewed one at a time or you can set the rate
to change from one frame to next automatically. There are many uses for
this type of function. For example, you could make small changes in
time and make a series showing the movement of an asteroid through the
solar system. Or use it to quickly blink between two FITS images, one
with and one without a potentially new supernova. You might find the <a
 href="#imreg">Image Registration</a> feature useful to make these
images.<br>
<br>
The <b>Control</b> menu has entries to <b>Delete current</b> frame or
<b>Delete all</b> frames of the movie. You may also <b>Save</b> the
frames to individual PNG files. You must specify a prefix then each
file name will be of the format prefixnnn.png where <i>nnn</i> will be
a sequence number starting with 000. The files will be located in the <a
 href="#SharedPrivateDirs">Private</a> directory. XEphem does not save
the frames directly as an actual movie because there are many such
formats and other tools available to collect the files into a movie in
your preferred format. For example, you could convert the PNG files
into GIF files using <em>pngtopnm</em> and <em>ppmtogif</em> tools
from the <a target="netpbm" href="https://netpbm.sourceforge.net">netpbm</a>
toolkit then make an
animated gif using&nbsp;
<a target="gifsicle" href="https://www.lcdf.org/%7Eeddietwo/gifsicle">gifsicle</a>.
Another possibility is to use <em>convert</em> which is part of the
<a target="imagemagick" href="https://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a>
collection. Check your system before looking too far, these tools are
often
already installed on many UN*X systems.<br>
<br>
Sliding the <b>Frame selection</b> scale will display the indicated
frame. <b>Step +1</b> and <b>-1</b> will advance or back up by one
frame. Frames may also be changed automatically by sliding the <b>Frames
per second</b> scale to the desired rate. Changing the displayed frame
manually by any means will automatically reset the frame rate back to
zero. When moving through the frames automatically and encountering the
last frame in the series, the sequence can either reverse and show each
frame back towards the first or jump back to the first and move
forwards again, depending on the <b>Bounce</b> toggle button.<br>
<br>
Each window whose contents may be added to a Movie will have an entry
somewhere in its menu bar named "Add to movie". All such windows also
support a short cut of typing Control-m to add the window to the Movie,
so long as the cursor focus is located within the desired window.<br

window allows you to load and delete database files to and from memory.
These objects form what is referred to as the XEphem database. These do

<br>
Click the <b>Files</b> menu to scan the <a href="#SharedPrivateDirs">Private

found therein. Click on a file to load it into XEphem memory.<br>
<br>
The top section of the window displays a count of each major type of
object and the total number in the database. The counts include <a
 href="#Favorites">Favorites</a> that are not also in the database.<br>
<br>
The bottom section lists the catalogs which are currently loaded and
the number of new objects they contributed to memory. Buttons to the
left of each catalog allow the catalog to be <span

the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Header</span> of the catalog.<br>

<b>Reload all</b><br>

automatic means. </blockquote>
<b>Open DB Fifo<br>

<blockquote> Listen for database objects arriving via a fifo from
another process. XEphem attempts to reopen the fifo each time the
button
is pressed. The file name of this fifo is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"</span>fifos/xephem_db_fifo" in either the
Private or Shared directory. All relevant displays are automatically updated
when data arrives via this fifo. The format of the fifo data is
exactly the same as for any XEphem database file. Due to the way the
fifo data is read and processed, it is important that each line be
terminated with a newline; incomplete last lines can result in loss
of information. </blockquote>
<b>Make Favorite when read 1<br>
</b>
<blockquote> If this toggle is on then when a new database file is
loaded and it defines exactly one object, it will also be assigned to
the list of <a href="#Favorites">Favorites</a>. This feature also
applies for files loaded when XEphem first starts.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Check alternate names</b><br>
<blockquote>This toggle turns on or off support for XEphem 3.6's new
support for alternate names. It is motivated entirely by performance.
Recording alternate names and checking for duplicates is quite
expensive and
if not needed can speed up loading and deleting catalogs significantly.
If this toggle is On then when a new database
catalog is loaded each entry's alternate names, if any, will be checked
for
already being loaded and not loaded if found, and new alternates will
be
stored for display and subsequent checking. If this toggle is Off, only
the
first name of each entry is stored and no duplicate names are checked.
Note that even when this option is Off, deleting a catalog still
requires
XEphem to remove all alternate names that might have been recorded when
the
catalog was loaded, so the full performance advantage is only achieved
if this
option was off when each catalog is loaded.<br>

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId564354"></a> 7.1.2.3 <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="mag_models"></a>Magnitude models</span></h4>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">g,k</span> magnitude model
requires two parameters to be specified. One, the absolute magnitude,
g, is the visual magnitude of the object if it were one AU from both
the Sun and the Earth. The other, the luminosity index, k,
characterizes the brightness change of the object as a function of its
distance from the Sun. This is generally zero, or very small, for
inactive objects like asteroids. The model may be expressed as:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family: monospace;">m
= g + 5*log10(D) + 2.5*k*log10(r)</span> </div>
<br>
where:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family: monospace;">m</span>
= resulting visual magnitude<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">g</span> = absolute visual
magnitude<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">D</span> = comet-earth distance,
in AU </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family: monospace;">k</span>
= luminosity index </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family: monospace;">r</span>
= comet-sun distance. </div>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">H,G</span> model also requires
two parameters. The first, H, is the magnitude of the object when one
AU from the Sun and the Earth. The other, G, attempts to model the
reflection characteristics of a passive surface, such as an asteroid.
The model may be expressed with the following code fragment:<br>
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family: monospace;">beta
= acos((rp*rp + rho*rho - rsn*rsn)/ (2*rp*rho));</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">psi_t =
exp(log(tan(beta/2.0))*0.63);</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Psi_1 = exp(-3.33*psi_t);</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">psi_t =
exp(log(tan(beta/2.0))*1.22);</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Psi_2 = exp(-1.87*psi_t);</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">m = H + 5.0*log10(rp*rho) -
2.5*log10((1-G)*Psi_1 + G*Psi_2);</span> </div>
<br>
where:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family: monospace;">m&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>=
resulting visual magnitude<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">rp&nbsp; </span>= distance from
sun to object<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">rho </span>= distance from
earth to object<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">rsn </span>= distance from
sun to earth </div>
<br>
Note that neither model takes into account the phase angle of sun light.<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId184653"></a> 7.1.3 Notes</h3>
<p>XEphem uses a different window to manage <a href="#FieldStars">Field
star</a> catalogs.</p>
<p>XEphem ships with a few perl scripts which might be helpful for
converting databases in other formats into XEphem format. These
scripts are in the tools/ directory of the source distribution tree.<br>
</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId74433"></a> 7.1.4 Two-line Earth
satellite element sets</h3>
XEphem supports reading files which contain Earth satellites defined
using the the NORAD "two-line element" set format, or TLE. Because the
TLE format is quite rigid and includes a checksum within each line,
XEphem is able to search files containing other arbitrary text and find
each properly formatted TLE contained therein. Follows is a description
of the TLE. Note the line immediately preceding the TLE, line "0", is
assumed to contain a common name for the satellite, this line is only
used if the following two lines conform to TLE.<br>
<br>
Data for each satellite consists of three lines in the following
format:
<pre>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>1 NNNNNU NNNNNAAA NNNNN.NNNNNNNN +.NNNNNNNN +NNNNN-N +NNNNN-N N NNNNN<br>2 NNNNN NNN.NNNN NNN.NNNN NNNNNNN NNN.NNNN NNN.NNNN NN.NNNNNNNNNNNNNN<br></pre>
<p>Line 0 is a twenty-four character name.<br>
</p>
<p>Lines 1 and 2 are the standard Two-Line Orbital Element Set Format
identical to that
used by NORAD and NASA. The format description is:<br>

<img alt="" src="png/favorites.png" align="right" height="448"
 hspace="10" width="219">This
window allows you to add, arrange, remove and temporarily deactivate an
arbitrary collection
of XEphem objects, called Favorites. Once defined as a Favorite, the
object remains available whether or not its original <a
 href="#Database">database file</a> is currently loaded. <br>
<br>
Favorites have special significance in several places throughout
XEphem. For example the rows in the <a href="#Data_Table">Data Table</a>
and in the <a href="#NightAtAGlance">Night at a Glance</a> windows are
exactly those of the Favorites. The <a href="#Earth">Earth</a> view
shows those Favorites which are satellites. Favorites are available
very
easily in the Favorites menu in the <a href="#SkyView">Sky View</a>.
And the <a href="#Solsys">Solar System</a> view displays those
Favorites
that are within the solar system.<br>
<br>
Objects may be added to the list of Favorites in several ways:<br>
<ul>
  <li>from the <span style="font-family: monospace;"><a href="#Object">Data

    <b>Favorite</b>;</li>
  <li>from buttons labeled <b>Favorite</b> located in several dialogs
throughout XEphem;<br>
  </li>
  <li>from buttons in the popup menus of several views when clicked
over displayed objects; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>by entering its .edb format definition in the text field near the
bottom of the Favorites window and clicking <b>Add edb</b>.<br>
      Note this field may also be used to edit an existing Favorite in-place.
  </li>
</ul>
Each entry in the Favorites list shows its complete .edb format
definition. Each entry has the following controls:<br>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Del</span><br>

XEphem's .edb format or the NORAD 2-Line Element (TLE) format commonly
used for Earth satellite. The file is saved in the <a

<br>
Several particularly useful sites as of this build are already entered.
The first five are from Dr. TS Kelso's Earth satellite lists at <a

the Minor Planet Center's lists of hot comets and unusual asteroids
specially formatted for <a

Each organization maintains
extensive lists of all known asteroids and produces on a regular basis
Keplarian orbital elements precessed to the current date. Both are of
excellent quality. When the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Get</span>

it, reformats it to .edb format and splits the results into two files
for convenience. One file will contain all asteroids which can ever
become brighter than magnitude 13, and the other (with a "_dim" suffix)
contains all the rest. All files are created in the user's Private
XEphem directory. The real work is performed by two perl scripts,
mpcorb2edb.pl and astorb2edb.pl, respectively. These may be run independently
of XEphem if desired.<br clear="all">

<h2><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId147305"></a> 7.5 Field Stars</h2>
&nbsp;<img alt="" src="png/fieldstars.png" align="right" height="345"
 hspace="10" vspace="10" width="546">This window allows you to control
which
field star
sources you wish to use. The window is accessible from the Main window
as well as from the Control menus of most graphical views.<br>
<br>
XEphem uses the term "field star" to refer to the huge numbers of faint
stars visible in any real world view of the sky. Field stars are
generally far more numerous than could be reasonably accommodated in
the XEphem *.edb database format. For this reason they are stored and
made available in their own special compact forms for utmost
efficiency. The downside to this approach is that field stars are not
included in the totals presented by the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Data &raquo; Files</span> window nor
are they available for searching or inspection using the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Data &raquo; Index</span> window.
This results in little loss of generality, however, since (once
found!) they may be assigned to the user Favorites.<br>
<br>
The controls in the Field Stars setup window are grouped into
categories, depending on the basic source of the stars, as follows:<br>
<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId160208"></a> 7.5.1 <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Hubble GSC</span></h3>
The Hubble Guide Star Catalog is a seminal work created by the Space
Telescope Science Institute to support the Hubble Space telescope. It
contains from 13 million unique stars, or about 300 stars per square
degree of sky.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ASP CDROM Directory<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This choice enables reading field stars
from the Hubble Guide Star Catalog made available some years ago
on two CDROMs published by the Astronomical Society of the
Pacific. Mount a CDROM somewhere onto your filesystem, type the
name of the mount directory in the text field provided then turn
this option on and press Apply. Note that XEphem assumes your CDROM
driver removes the trailing ";1" from all filenames.<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Local Cache Directory</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This choice enables reading GSC field
stars from your local disk. If this option is on along with the
CDROM option, then as requests are satisfied from the CDROM a
compact form of the same data will be written to files below the
directory named in this option. Then the next time the same field stars
are needed, and this option is on, they will be obtained from the
local disk files rather than the CDROM. In fact, the CDROM is not
needed
or used if the local disk contains all the stars for any given
access. The entire 2 CDROM set loads onto disk in this format in
some 180 MB. The default path of the directory which holds the
disk version is "catalogs/gsc" off the Shared directory. Note:
There is also a utility in the tools/gsc directory, gscload, with
which you may preload any entire CDROM segment at once if desired.
These files are already included in te commercial version of
XEphem.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Internet to xephemdbd<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This choice is to use the Internet to
access an XEphem GSC server. To use this source, select this
option and type the URL to the remote xephemdbd.pl in the text
field provided.<br>
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
GSC 2.2 Directory<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This choice enables using a local copy
of the GSC 2.2.0.1 catalog in xe3 format. This catalog only contains
stars between magnitude 10 and 18.5, so it must be used in conjunction
with
an additional catalog for completeness. The Hipparcos catalog is an
ideal companion and is automatically chosen as a convenience.
<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId676533"></a> 7.5.2 <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">USNO A or SA catalogs</span></h3>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Root directory</span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <br>
This choice of field stars supports the SA and the A series of
astrometric catalogs produced by the US Naval Observatory. The SA2.0
for example, includes some 54 million stars, about a tenth of the parent A2.0,
spatially sampled so there is about 1,300 stars per square degree of
sky. Note that such a uniform distribution does not "look" much like
the real sky, but it is great for its intended use as an astrometric
mesh for comet hunters or such. If you have such a catalog, simply
enter the name of its base directory and toggle this switch on.
The default assumes a symbolic link, "catalogs/usno" off the shared
directory. Multiple versions of the catalogs can be stored, each in
its own directory, but only one may be active at a time.<br>
<br>
The suggested citation for SA2.0 follows:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Monet, D., Bird, A., Canzian, B.,
Dahn, C., Guetter, H., Harris, H., Henden, A., Levine, S., Luginbuhl, C.,
Monet, A., Rhodes, A., Riepe, B., Sell, S., Stone, R., Vrba, F., Walker, R.,
1998, USNO-SA2.0, (U.S. Naval Observatory, Washington DC). </div>
<br>
This catalog has been included with permission of USNO as long as
we mention the following stipulations:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> It may not be the latest version,
check with https://www.usno.navy.mil. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> If you paid for XEphem, you paid for
the software, not this catalog. The catalog is available free from
the USNO. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Inclusion of the SA2.0 catalog does
not imply an endorsement of XEphem by USNO; nor was there privileged
access to the catalog; nor does the US Government affirm or
guarantee that XEphem works properly in any way. </div>
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId619625"></a> 7.5.3 <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Proper Motion catalogs</span></h3>
<br>
These large catalogs include information regarding proper motion.
Two such catalogs are currently available ready for XEphem. You may
only use one at a time, by choosing the corresponding toggle<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
PPM catalog</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is the Positions and Proper Motion
catalog of S. Roeser and U. Bastian, Astronomisches
Rechen-Institut, Heidelberg, published in 1990. The PPM includes
468,586 stars rather evenly distributed throughout both
hemispheres. This averages out to more than 10 stars per square
degree. The set here includes the original North and South
editions plus the extended supplement. The set includes more than
99% of the stars in the original SAO catalog and some 70% of the
Henry Draper Catalogue (HD). While the SAO catalog is more or less
complete to V=9, with stars as faint as V=10, the PPM catalog is
fairly complete to V=9.5, and goes somewhat deeper than V=10.<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hipparcos and Tycho-2</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This catalog is a combination of the
Hipparcos and the Tycho-2 astrometric catalogs published by the
European Space Agency. This catalog contains all Hipparcos stars
for which astrometric and magnitude values are assigned, and all
additional non-redundant entries from the Tycho-2 catalog except
multiple-component entries. There is a total of some 2.5 million
stars, or about 60 stars per square degree. One example of a star with
high proper motion is Groombridge 1830 (HD 103095), in Ursa Major,
near 11h53m 37d44m. For a nice discussion see Burnham's Celestial
Handbook, Volume III, page 1978. By comparing its position in either
PM catalog with the same entry from the GSC one can deduce this
particular GSC field was evidently taken in early 1983.<br>
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
UCAC</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
This choice allows using the USNO Astrographic catalog with XEphem. For
more information on this catalog please refer to
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astrometry/optical-IR-prod/ucac">here</a>.
As of release UCAC4, the directory specified must be that which contains
the u4b and u4i directories. In turn, u4b must contain all 900 z files and
u4i must contain u4index.unf and u4hpm.dat.
<br>
</div>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId802428"></a> 7.5.4 <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Skip likely duplicates</span></h3>
All of the above may be used together with the regular database
facility of XEphem. If this option is on, XEphem eliminates what
appears to be redundant entries for the same star from the various
catalogs. Two stars are considered the same if their positions match
within the given number of arcseconds and their brightnesses differ by
less than the given number of magnitudes. (The generous default
magnitude tolerance is because the GSC and the PPM use varying
filters).<br>
<br>
When deciding on the final selection for such duplicate entries the
highest priority is the local database, then the HD or SAO entry,
then the PPM entry, then Hipparcos, then Tycho and finally the GSC
entry.When you have made the desired entries, pressing <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Apply</span> will attempt to check each
filename, directory and Internet choice, as appropriate. The cursor
will be a Watch while the tests are in progress. If something does not
seem correct, a warning window will appear and the option will be
turned back off. If everything seems to be operating correctly, you
are in business. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ok</span> button
does the same thing but then also closes the window if they all
succeed.<br>
<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId289990"></a> 7.5.5 Notes</h3>
If at any time something goes wrong during the acquisition of any
Field Stars from any View, the responsible option in that view is also
turned off automatically. The problem should be corrected and Field
stars turned on again.<br>
<br>
All field star sources will silently enforce limits on the total number
of stars they yield for any query. As of this writing, local queries
except USNO are limited to 30 degrees; USNO are limited to 15 degrees;
network queries impose various limits.<br>

Fonts that have been changed from their default values are tagged in
the <span style="font-family: monospace;">Preferences &raquo; Save</span>
window (when opened or after you do a Refresh). This allows you to Save
the new fonts set here permanently. If you do not Save it, the change
only effects XEphem until you exit.<br>
<br>
There are a few situations scattered around within XEphem for which
changing fonts at runtime from this window does not work perfectly.
For example, changing to a smaller font does not shrink some windows
as much as you might expect. Such anomalies are known challenges and
do not indicate serious problems. After Saving the fonts and
restarting XEphem, all will work again as expected.<br>

colors used by XEphem. The basic technique is to use the four toggle
buttons to choose which action to take then perform the action in a
particular color context by clicking in the menus accessed from the
menubar across the top.<br>
<br>
The possible actions are as follows:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Get current</span><br>

<br>
Above the color patch are three sliding scales that allow you to define
a color using either Red+Green+Blue or Hue+Saturation+Value, depending
on the toggle. Each scale ranges from 0 through 255. Hue is the basic
spectral color, where 0 is red, 85 is green, 170 is blue. Saturation
is the amount of color purity, where lower values mix in more white.
Value is like brightness, where 0 is totally black.<br>
<br>
The text field at lower left allows you to type a color using one of
the standard descriptive names, such as "steel blue", or in hex RGB
notation, for example #ff0000 for pure red, #00ff00 for pure green
#0000ff for pure blue. After typing the desired value, press Enter to
set the scales and see the color in the patch. This field is also set
automatically when the scales are used to set a color, during Grabbing
(see next), and when a color context is retrieved.<br>
<br>
The history list in the lower left stores each color name that is used
from the name field, making it easier to reuse a color. Selecting a
name
will copy it to the name field and show it in the color patch. You can
select history entries with the mouse, or by browsing with the Up and
Down keyboard arrow keys.<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId803196"></a> 8.2.2 Star colors</h3>
XEphem assigns colors to stars based on their spectral classification.
The default colors were chosen based on work done by <a
 href="https://www.vendian.org/mncharity/dir3/starcolor">Mitchell Charity</a>.
The colors are specified using X Resources. The resource names each
begin with "XEphem.starSpect" followed by one or two characters. The
value of the resource is the color. The following table shows the
default spectral color resources built into XEphem:<br>

XEphem uses the closest entry with matching first character. If no
entry is found with matching first character then white is used and a
message is added to the&nbsp;<a href="#SysLog">System log</a>. The
spectral color resource values may be edited or additional resources
can
be added but this must be done by hand, there is no GUI support
available. Always edit the XEphem resource file while XEphem is <span
 style="font-style: italic;">not running</span> to avoid any chance of
conflict.<br>

<img alt="" src="png/save-resources.png" align="right" height="290"
 hspace="10" vspace="5" width="394">This window displays all of the
options,
settings and controls, collectively called Preferences, throughout
XEphem that may be saved and
reinstated next time the program is started. XEphem has many such
preferences, so
they are separated into categories in this window for easier
management. Each category may be expanded or collapsed using the
+/-&nbsp; toggle square to show each individual preference.<br>
<br>
Preferences are saved using the standard Resource mechanism provided by
the X Window System. These resources are saved in the file <b>XEphem</b>
located in the <a href="#SharedPrivateDirs">Private</a> directory.<br>
<br>
Each preference may be tagged for saving. The toggle at the top
controls whether all tagged preferences will be <b>Autoatically save</b>d
when XEphem is Quit.<br>
<br>
Preferences have been divided into two classes.<br>
<blockquote><b>Major</b>: In the opinion of the author these
preferences are sufficiently interesting that they are likely to be
worth saving and automatically restoring between one invocation of
XEphem and the next.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Minor</b>: Everything else, presumably less critical in nature. It
is expected that you are likely to
change these preferences frequently in due course while operating
XEphem yet they do not cause major effects on program behavior so
saving them at
any one particular setting is not especially compelling. Minor
preferences are things like window size and position, scale settings
which
only effect views, and all of the Sky View Filter and Option settings.<br>
  <br>
This distinction is of course rather arbitrary so please take
care when changing and saving preferences so the ones you want are
saved.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The number of preferences in each class currently tagged
for saving is indicated by messages near the top.<br>
</blockquote>
The scrolled area can display each preference, whether it is tagged for
saving and the ability to change whether it is tagged. Each category of
preference can be expanded for more detail using the +/- toggle square.<br>
<blockquote>In the expanded view, each preference and its value are
shown exactly
as it will appear in the disk file if Saved. Those preferences
which differ from the last time they were Saved, or since XEphem was
started if no Save has yet occurred, are marked with a bullet. Major
preferences are marked with a solid bullet, Minor preferences with an
hollow
bullet. A toggle next to each preference allows individual selection
over whether the preference will be written to disk on the next Save.
After each Refresh, the toggles are set for those preferences found to
have changed since the last Save if their class is set to be
automatically tagged. Each toggle may be changed manually in either
direction to override this automatic behavior on an individual basis
if desired but not these will be overridden with the next Refresh.<br>
  <br>
In the collapsed view, if at least one Major preference is out of date
in a category, a solid bullet is placed next to the category heading;
otherwise if at least one Minor preference is out of date a hollow
bullet is used.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Note that the information in this window does <em>not</em>
automatically track changes in preferences as XEphem is used. You must
use Refresh to update the status manually when desired. In particular,
the values which are Saved are what they were the last time Refresh
was performed, not what they actually are at the moment Save is
activated.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Save now</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Write each tagged preference to disk to
the XEphem resource file.
If the file already exists, it will first be copied to XEphem.bak in
the same directory. If a preference already exists in the file it will
be
edited in-place, otherwise a new entry is added at the bottom. Other
lines in the file are left unchanged. After using Save, all preferences
will be considered up to date, even if they were not selected to be
written to the preference file. </div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> N.B. The values saved are as they
appear in this window, which may be different from their current
value if they have changed since the last Refresh. </div>

<h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId539636"></a> 9.0 <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Multifunction Tools</span></h1>
The tools in this section are used in several different places
throughout XEphem. The descriptions here are generic. If there are any
special issues when used in certain contexts they will be described in
the appropriate sections elsewhere.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
<a name="Trails"></a>
<h2><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId242681"></a> 9.1 Trails</h2>
<img alt="" src="png/trails.png" align="right" height="416" hspace="20"
 width="400"> This
window allows you to define a set of time values spaced at regular
intervals before and after the current XEphem time and define which
and in what manner values will be annotated with a time stamp.<br>
<br>
This is a general purpose facility used in several places throughout
XEphem, generally for the purpose of establishing a trail of object
motion. This description will be of a general nature.<br>
<br>
Six format parameters must be specified:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Orientation<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This choice determines where the
stamps
appear in relation to their corresponding position mark. The first
several options should be self-explanatory. The last two, Path-left and
Path-right, cause the time stamps
to be placed to the left or right side of the trail path, as one would
perceive these directions when traversed in forward time order. In
no case are the time stamps ever drawn to require you to turn your
head more than 90 degrees left or right. </div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Interval</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This is the time interval between each
step. Choose from among several predefined intervals or choose Custom
and enter any desired interval
in the space provided. It is okay to specify more than 24 hours to
achieve intervals of several days. It is also okay to specify negative
values to run time backwards. </div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Label</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This choice determines which intervals
will to be labeled with a time stamp. Choose from among several
options or choose None if no labeling
is desired. Times will be printed surrounded by parentheses if the
object is an Earth satellite and it is eclipsed.</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Format</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This choice determines the format in
which to display
each time-stamp. Choose Hour:Minute
with or without Seconds or the date formatted as per the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Preferences &raquo; Date formats</span>
option in the Main menubar, see <a href="#MainMenu_preferences">Preferences</a>.</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Font</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This choice sets the size of the
annotation text font. </div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Start</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This choice specifies how the first
time value is derived from the current XEphem time. The lower right
radio box offers several methods of determining the beginning of the
first time interval. The idea here is generally to match the time
values of each time mark with the precision implied by the format, but
to allow other options for special situations.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Whole min</span> rounds the current
XEphem time forward to the next whole minute, if necessary;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Whole day</span> rounds to the next
whole day.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Whole interval</span> rounds to the
next whole multiple of whatever time interval is set (as specified
in the Intervals choices).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Now</span> means to begin with the
current XEphem time without any initial changes. </div>
<br>
Two scales near the bottom specify the number of tick marks to create
before and after the starting time.<br>
<br>
Once the choices are set up as desired, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Ok</span> will create the trail and the
window will disappear. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Apply</span>
will create the trail but the window will remain up for further use. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Close</span> just dismisses the window
without creating a trail.<br>
<br>
Even with all this flexibility pleasingly annotated trails are not
trivial to generate. It is hoped that a little experimentation can
yield acceptable results in most cases. Note that this general trail
facility does not provide close coupling with the view being
supported. For example, some views do not support setting a trail for
an object which has changed while the Trail Setup is up. Also, views
may vary in their support of having trails defined while they are not
visible. Each view may establish its own initial default values but
changes usually remain in effect for subsequent instances of Trail
Setup windows from the same view. Some views permit more than one
Trail Setup to be active at one time. In short, the operational
boundary conditions vary by view. <br>
<br>
The settings for each view context may be saved using
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Preferences &raquo; Save</span>.

champion of the elegance of the UNIX architecture, life-long friend
and mentor.</p>
<p>Special thanks to all the folks over the years who have provided
innumerable ideas, suggestions and bug reports, both for XEphem and
its ancestor, ephem. A major benefit to writing and distributing these

<h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId402656"></a> 11.0 Notes</h1>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId610542"></a> 11.1 <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Horizon</span></h2>
XEphem uses a horizontal plane tangent to the Earth at Elev feet
above sea level as the horizon for all altitude calculations, rise/set
events, etc. Due to Earth's curvature, this is not the same as the
angle up from the local horizon unless the observer is directly on the
ground. The effect can be found from:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family: monospace;">sin(a)**2
= (h**2 + 2Rh) / (R+h)**2</span> </div>
<br>
where:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> R = radius of earth<br>
h = height above ground (same units as R)<br>
a = increase in altitude </div>
<br>
The effect is remarkably significant. For example, it is more than
two arc minutes at a height of just 5 feet.<br>
<br>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId730559"></a> 11.2 <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="glob"></a>glob Patterns<br>
</span></h2>
Some of the searches in XEphem can be performed using glob patterns.
The term glob refers to a limited form of pattern matching (limited
with respect to the more capable "regular expression") historically
originating in the UNIX shells for the purposes of specifying a
collection of file names. In XEphem the glob patterns are implemented
using the fnmatch() POSIX function. On GNU systems the flag
FNM_CASEFOLD can be used to make the pattern case insensitive. A glob
pattern is a set of normal text characters interspersed with any of the
following special characters known as wildcards:<br>
<br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"
 width="585">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><b>glob wildcard</b><br>
      </td>
      <td valign="top"><b>Meaning</b><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">
      <blockquote>?<br>
      </blockquote>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">matches exactly one character</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">
      <blockquote>*<br>
      </blockquote>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">matches zero or more characters</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">
      <blockquote>[abc]<br>
      </blockquote>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">matches any one of the specified characters. A
pair of
characters separated by a hyphen denotes a range expression such that
any character&nbsp; that sorts between those two characters, inclusive,
is matched. If the first character following the [ is a !&nbsp; or a ^
then any character <i>not</i> enclosed is matched.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
For example, if a list of candidates consists of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aabc<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abbc<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acc<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adc<br>
<br>
then the pattern a* matches all; ab* matches abc and abbc; a[ac]*
matches aabc and abbc; a?c matches abc, acc and adc; a[a-c]c matches
abc and acc; a[^a-c]c matches adc; and *b* matches abc, aabc and abbc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId730558"></a> 11.3 <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Accuracy</span></h2>
In the period 1689 through 2247 Jupiter and beyond use CHAPRONT J.,
Astron. Astrophys. Suppl. Ser. 109, 181 (1995), otherwise all planetary
ephemerides except Pluto use VSOP87 from Bretagnon P., Francou G.,
Astron. Astrophys. 202, 309 (1988). Compared with JPL DE200 for
Mercury, Venus and Mars the accuracy of this model rises to 1" at the
ends of the year range 2000 +/- 4000. For Jupiter and Saturn, the 1"
range is 2000 +/- 2000. For Uranus and Neptune, it is 2000 +/- 6000.<br>
<br>
Lunar ephemerides are from S. L. Moshier, December, 1996, available
from ftp://ftp.std.com/pub/astronomy/selenog.zip. Compared with JPL
DE404 the accuracy is better than 0.5" for the period -1369 to +2950.<br>
<br>
Other heliocentric objects are well within one arc minute at the time
of the epoch of their elements; this steadily worsens with time since
XEphem does not apply perturbations.<br>
<br>
Using a GPS position locator and transit, I have independently verified
Sun and Moon limb rise and set times are accurate to within one minute
and azimuths are within about 0.1 degree.<br>
<br>
The natural satellite model from BDL used for 1999-2010 is stated as
good to 1/2 arcsecond accuracy. In my tests against JPL DE405 I would
say this is true about 50% of the time, with a worst case of about 4
AS.<br>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId866585"></a> 11.6 History</h2>
In 1981 I purchased a genuine IBM PC. Soon I was building a character
oriented program in C for DOS that displayed ephemeris data, packing as
much as possible on the character-based 24x80 display. That program was
called <span style="font-style: italic;">ephem</span> because it was
as much of the
word <span style="font-style: italic;">ephemeris</span> that would fit
in 8 characters and still retain some sensible meaning. I was using
UNIX at work
so
I made sure it would run there too using the <i>curses</i> library. In
1989 I took a course in Motif. By 1990 it seemed to
have won the UNIX desktop wars so I started converting <i>ephem</i> to
Motif+UNIX. The convention for naming X Window System programs was to
add an <span style="font-style: italic;">x</span> prefix so that
program
was named <span style="font-style: italic;">xephem</span>. I have been
diddling with it ever since. The original <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ephem</span> is still <a
 href="https://www.clearskyinstitute.com/ephem/">available</a>.<br>
